Everyone is aware of crypto these days. Once obscure, these digital assets are rapidly integrating into the mainstream, particularly in the realm of e-commerce. The industry is predicted to grow from its previous perception as a niche investment for tech enthusiasts to $2.9 billion by 2030. The increasing digitisation of various aspects of life demands the recognition of virtual currency as an authentic asset, not merely a passing fad. This article will examine why the e-commerce industry is open to accept crypto as a viable payment solution, as well as what benefits it presents. The unpredictable adoption rates of cryptocurrencies make it challenging to estimate the size of the market. The Global Crypto Adoption Index indicated that adoption peaked in Q2 2021. However, affected by economic concerns and market instability, cryptocurrency ownership proceeded to witness significant fluctuations. According to stats, adult crypto ownership rates in the United States fell slightly from 33% in 2022 to 30% in 2023. However, with 60% of respondents saying they are familiar with the idea, there appears to be a good chance that the use of digital currencies will rise as technology becomes more widely available. Though, the use of cryptocurrency is still quite low. According to the same survey, 38% of cryptocurrency users were lured to the technology, whereas only 13% of users bought crypto for usage in online transactions. aims to overcome the drawbacks of conventional payment methods to enhance the consumer experience. As the needs for online commerce change, cryptocurrencies present a viable way to conduct transactions more quickly. This and decreasing trust in conventional institutions suggest that future perceptions and usage of cryptocurrencies may change. Using cryptocurrency for gives e-commerce companies a number of advantages over competitors: E-commerce sites can reach a wider audience worldwide with cryptocurrencies. are not always accessible everywhere and may have regional limitations. Companies looking to conduct business often choose to use cryptocurrencies because of their ease of use and absence of global regulation. Businesses can avoid the high fees associated with using credit cards by accepting cryptocurrencies. Customers and businesses may save money as a result of the typically lower fees connected with digital asset transactions, which would cut the price of goods and services. Transactions using cryptocurrencies are highly secure since they are decentralised. As a transaction is almost impossible to undo after completion, the likelihood of fraud is greatly decreased. Adopting blockchain technology provides an extra layer of protection against chargebacks and fraudulent actions, protecting merchants and customers in the online marketplace. With cryptocurrency, a wide range of e-commerce applications are feasible: Loyalty Programmes: The innovative and safe benefits that customers may now enjoy as a result of blockchain technology increase the allure of . Benefits like loyalty tokens are ensured to be fair and secure due to the immutability of blockchain technology, which increases engagement and confidence. Web 3.0 and Metaverse: With its immersive purchasing experience, cryptocurrency is a key component of both Web 3.0 and the metaverse. It enhances user engagement by facilitating transactions for virtual money and collectables. Supply Chain Transparency: Supply chain integrity and product manufacturing can be transparently verified by using blockchain for tracking. This highlights a brand's dedication to integrity in the fight against fake goods and unscrupulous business methods. Specialised Marketplaces: With the emergence of virtual assets, specialised peer-to-peer networks marketplaces have been established. These platforms give merchants new chances to reach larger audiences and increase their market presence by providing safer transactions and lower operating costs. Companies that accept crypto as payment have a unique opportunity to gain a lot from this technology and other innovations in the industry. In addition to the advantages mentioned earlier, using cryptocurrency for payments has enormous potential to grow the e-commerce sector. "},

During the Bitcoin Policy Summit, policymakers from across the U.S. government, including five members of Congress, spoke with industry representatives and the bitcoin community. I attended as a speaker on countering digital authoritarianism, highlighting different parts of the world that were embracing central bank digital currencies, and what role the United States could play in leveraging bitcoin to ensure its use as a tool of freedom and resilience. There were many lessons learned, but a few can make for a powerful summary. Despite the reputation of having Bitcoin as a divisive topic that can fall under the traditional “red vs. blue” debate, we saw two Democratic members of Congress, and three Republicans Members of Congress from a variety of states talk about why they thought Bitcoin benefited the United States. Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn., host state of Bitcoin 2024) all brought passionate speeches talking about the value of Bitcoin and how it could benefit their constituents. Lummis in particular brought forward a passionate defense of why bitcoin scared members of the government who tried to control it. On the House side, outgoing House Financial Services Chair Rep. McHenry (R-N.C.) and Rep. Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.) brought forward their views on bitcoin. Executive branch employees from across the different cabinets of the United States also joined in, with representation from the Treasury Department, Energy Department and more. The speakers didn’t talk about the benefits of bitcoin for their political party, but rather how the United States should study and consider leveraging it. This was a rare tone in a political process that might often be more known for partisan-level sniping rather than broad consensus and consideration. Having said that, bitcoin isn’t immune from political maneuvering. Policymakers mentioned that the Financial Services Committee was quite pro-bitcoin, but Senate Banking Committee tended not to be. Yet it was refreshing to hear policymakers talk about bitcoin in a more reflective tone rather than a reactive one shaped by partisan talking points. The Bitcoin Policy Summit drew a full house, with many legislative staffers, policy analysts and policymakers from various parts of the federal government. The seats were packed, and the general attitude was one of curiosity. There was a sense that Bitcoin had grown through another maturation stage. For the policymakers, the ETF approvals were an inflection point, something that gave bitcoin more of a “grown-up” appearance. The full crowd of policy folks at the Bitcoin Policy Summit gave credence to the idea that bitcoin was now no longer just a side topic in Washington, but rather something that could generate a large amount of interest. The entire conference was noticeable for having no panels that directly discussed the price of bitcoin and how to trade it. There wasn’t any “expert” that came in and said this model could perfectly predict bitcoin’s price at this entry point or exit point. While price movement and the consideration of price are important, it felt like the conference was curated and organically resonated around bitcoin’s use as a tool, and it featured several human rights activists, including Anna Chekhovich, who served served as financial director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation founded by Alexei Navalny. I had written previously about bitcoin mining after China’s bitcoin mining ban. The consequences of that were clear during the conference, whose major sponsors were mostly publicly traded miners now based in the United States. The world’s largest mining pool, Foundry Group, is now based in the United States. There are now companies like Riot, Cleanspark and Marathon that contribute significantly to bitcoin’s security and computing power. Bitcoin mining is one of the rare gifts that the Chinese party-state has given the United States. Many miners talked about the employment benefits they provided. For example, Jason Les of Riot discussed the 600 rural jobs that Riot generated, and Fred Thiel, the CEO of Marathon, mentioned a shrimp farm powered by heat from bitcoin mining, converting an economically productive activity to a second-order one. Instead of following the trendline of giving up long-term intellectual capital and skills development for short-term profits (as happened with fields as diverse as solar panel manufacturing and the creation of semiconductor foundries), bitcoin mining offers the opportunity for the United States to capitalise on skills clusters that China forbade on ideological reasons, with the added bonus of further decentralising hash rate dedicated to bitcoin’s security. Members of Generation Bitcoin were among the attendees, as well as the moderators. One of the speakers for example, was Arsh Molu who interviewed Roya Mahboob. He is the founder of Generation Bitcoin, which worked with Bitcoin Magazine to give students free entry to Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville. It was a great demonstration that bitcoin is popular among all age groups, and that young people today are interested in bitcoin. The Bitcoin Policy Summit was an engaging event that brought together bitcoiners and policymakers together into an active discussion. It placed the United States among a number of countries that are considering bitcoin for its benefits, rather than countries like China that have tried to ban it. Given the global leadership role the United States has, the lessons and interactions that came about because of the Summit may very well resonate across the world in time.  "},

Abir believes that the digital shekel has the potential to enhance competition in the financial system and benefit the economy as a whole. Israeli central bank official, Andrew Abir, sees the introduction of the digital shekel as a catalyst for technological advancements that will drive competition in the banking sector. He acknowledges the ongoing efforts to increase competition in the Israeli banking industry and states that there is still a long way to go. Abir notes that public sentiment towards commercial banks in Israel is not always favorable, and part of the discontent stems from the need to improve competition in certain segments of the industry. The digital shekel, currently in the planning stages, is designed to include an option for paying interest. Abir assures the public that the digital shekel will be developed by the Bank of Israel, a trusted institution that stands behind the traditional cash system. He emphasizes that the digital shekel will not be created by an anonymous entity like Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, but rather by a transparent and accountable central bank. Abir highlights the advantages of introducing a digital shekel for the Bank of Israel as well. It would provide the central bank with greater accessibility to central bank money, facilitating its use in digital payments. This would counteract the declining trend in central bank money usage resulting from advancements in the private sector. Additionally, the digital shekel could incentivize commercial banks to offer higher interest rates to customers, as the option to hold digital shekels would increase competition. The digital shekel has garnered strong support among the Israeli public, indicating a positive reception for the potential benefits it offers. The introduction of a CBDC like the digital shekel is seen as a step towards enhancing competition in the financial system, driving innovation, and ultimately benefiting the Israeli economy. As the Bank of Israel continues to develop the digital shekel, it aims to create a trusted and efficient digital currency that aligns with the country's financial goals. With the support of central bank officials like Andrew Abir, the digital shekel has the potential to revolutionize the Israeli banking industry and pave the way for a more competitive and technologically advanced financial system.

Global leader in semiconductor technology Samsung Electronics recently revealed that it has obtained US government funds totaling $6.4 billion to expand its chip manufacturing facilities in Texas. The United States' ability to produce chips domestically will be greatly enhanced by this huge investment, especially in sectors like aerospace, defence, and automotive. The 2022 Chips and Science Act, a piece of legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden, provides the financing for this expansion. The act's goal is to improve and revive the country's output of cutting-edge computer chips. It is anticipated that the government assistance and private investments would total more than $40 billion, which will significantly strengthen the semiconductor sector. By establishing a cutting-edge semiconductor ecosystem in Texas, the planned initiative would lead the state to the forefront of chip production. Two production facilities that can produce two- and four-nanometer chips, which are essential for cutting-edge technological applications, are part of the expansion plans. A specific research and development facility will also be built in order to promote creativity and technical breakthroughs in the semiconductor industry. A packaging factory that assembles and packages chip components is another component of the project. It is anticipated that the first manufacturing plant will open in 2026, and the second facility will open in 2027. Additionally, the funding will help Samsung expand its current semiconductor production plant in Austin, Texas, strengthening the company's position in the area. The project is expected to significantly strengthen the local economy by generating over 4,500 manufacturing employment and around 17,000 construction jobs. By increasing its capacity for chip production, Samsung will help achieve the target of having 20% of the world's cutting-edge chips made in the US by the end of the decade. Critical sectors including automotive, aerospace, and defence are seeing a surge in demand for sophisticated chips, which will be met in part by the expanded manufacturing capacity. Additionally, by allowing Samsung to produce semiconductors directly for the Defence Department and lowering dependency on outside suppliers, the expansion will strengthen national security in the United States.

IRS criminal investigation chief Guy Ficco predicts a rise in charged Title 26 crypto cases this year and beyond. While crypto has been associated with various financial crimes in the past, Ficco anticipates a surge in \"pure crypto tax crimes\" in the future. As the tax season draws to a conclusion, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States is getting ready for the possibility of an increase in the number of cases involving crypto tax crimes. Guy Ficco, the head of the IRS's criminal investigative division, has said that he anticipates an increase in the number of Title 26 crypto cases that will be prosecuted this year and in the years which will follow . Over the course of many years, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been conducting investigations into crypto assets, often as a component of bigger fraud cases, schemes, embezzlements, and money laundering operations. On the other hand, Ficco draws attention to a phenomenon known as \"pure crypto tax crimes,\" which are defined as infractions of federal income tax laws that are directly associated with cryptocurrency. According to Ficco, these offences related to cryptocurrency might manifest themselves in a variety of ways, including the failure to disclose money derived from the sale of cryptocurrency or the effort to conceal the actual foundation of cryptocurrency assets. The Internal Revenue Service has already seen an increase in the number of instances of this kind and believes that there will be much more rise in the future. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been working with blockchain companies like as Chainalysis in order to solve the issues that are created by crypto tax evasion. Through this agreement, the agency is able to acquire important tools for analysing complicated crypto transactions, which helps in the identification and investigation of tax offences in a more effective manner. Agents of the Internal Revenue Service are able to track money transactions and discover essential information about cryptocurrency ownership by using Chainalysis and using other technologies. Because of this partnership, tax offences using cryptocurrencies have been identified and addressed, which has proved to be an important advancement. It should be brought to your attention that financial crimes using cryptocurrencies have also resulted in some of the greatest seizures that the United States government has ever carried out. Over the course of the last several years, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigation division has significantly contributed to these efforts, further highlighting the agency's dedication to the fight against crypto tax evasion. On April 15, taxpayers will be filing their returns, and the Internal Revenue Service is getting ready to deal with the expected increase in instances of cyber tax crime. It is a reflection of the rising significance of digital assets in the wider financial environment that the agency is concentrating its efforts on ensuring tax compliance in the cryptocurrency market.

For all the hype about artificial intelligence revolutionizing the world, its impact on the boardroom has so far been minimal. Until very recently, many corporations would have found the idea of appointing a chief metaverse or chief artificial intelligence officer laughable, yet the latter is quickly becoming the C-suite’s hottest new role. Despite not even existing just a few years ago, these new C-level positions are being filled not just at bleeding-edge startups but in more established enterprises, too. According to Foundry’s AI Priorities Study 2023, 11% of midsize to large organizations have already designated an individual for the chief AI officer (CAIO) role, and another 21% of organizations are actively seeking one. Key roles added to support generative AI. But simply appointing a new member of C-Suite is no guarantee you’ll solve the challenges or reap the opportunities presented by AI or Web3. A well placed hire to get AI embedded in your company’s DNA can be the ticket to a fast, innovative approach. As Teresa Carlson, an advisor at General Catalyst and the former Worldwide Public Sector executive for Amazon Web Services, told me, “In the U.S. government, CAIO roles will serve as a critical leadership position as they transition the use of AI in mission critical capabilities. A relevant example is the U.S. intelligence community just named John Beiler as the chief artificial intelligence officer at the office of the Director of National Intelligence. His role will be to direct the deployment of AI and machine learning along with covering privacy, protections, and civil liberties that of course must be taken into account when the IC develops algorithms. The IC community will need a consolidated view across all agencies on an AI strategy which the CIO will play a critical role.” Teresa Carlson speaks at an event in New York. The much harder (though ultimately far more valuable) task is to understand how these roles contribute to your organization’s core strategy, what kind of work they actually entail, and how new technologies transform the dynamics and responsibilities within the boardroom. That may require a new, dedicated CxO. Equally, it might be far better to evolve an existing role. So rather than rushing to fill a new boardroom chair, businesses would do better to take a breath and work out precisely what they want to achieve—and who’s best to do it. On the face of it, creating one of these new “chief” job roles makes sense. Who better to champion and oversee the transformative capabilities of AI and the metaverse than someone with a dedicated seat at the top table? But hang on a second. Let’s say your organization is an insurance firm—one of the many industries that are profoundly affected by AI. What’s the value in appointing a data scientist to the C-suite if they don’t know the difference between an underwriter and a broker, say? The key lesson is: Don’t be dazzled by people who know how AI works. Never forget that you will always know your own business better than they do—and that’s what matters most. An installation uses artificial intelligence to visualize historical documents and photographs. There’s a very good argument that the best person to take on responsibility for AI initiatives already sits in the boardroom. For example, the chief marketing officer (if that’s where AI is going to have the most meaningful, transformative and strategic impact on your business). By the same token, it might be the chief technology officer, given this role requires a thorough understanding of both tech and business priorities. It could even be the CEO. Recent history gives us examples of how new job titles are often subsumed into other, more traditional C-suite roles. We only have to look at the chief cloud officer (CCO) role, a position that was crucial as we transitioned into the cloud computing era, but which eventually just came to be a standard part of the CTO or CIO’s responsibilities. The same fate could feasibly fall on the CAIO and CMO, although events like CAIO Summit 2023 are working to make them indispensable. On the other hand, having a dedicated CxO may well be the best option. Lan Guan agrees. As the chief AI officer at Accenture ACN and an exceptional female leader at a huge multinational IT company with over 730,000 employees, she told me she believes every business should have a CAIO. “Artificial intelligence doesn’t happen in a vacuum,” she says. “It needs evangelists and champions. Above all, it needs leaders. We weren’t alone in seeing the enormous potential of generative combined with classical AI to transform the enterprise, but that wouldn’t have happened nearly as fast or as well without creating a dedicated role.” Lan Guan is the chief artificial intelligence officer at Accenture. No matter how advanced, technology is always a tool that works best when applied to clearly defined and well-understood problems. It is always the servant of wider organizational goals rather than your business’ master. That’s why the best people to oversee AI and Metaverse initiatives might well be those who are already in charge. I know from personal experience just how impactful an effective chief metaverse or artificial intelligence officer can be in transforming a business. But real success depends not on the role itself, but how well enterprises understand the changes within the traditional boardroom dynamic that they entail. Because these new technologies have a virtually unlimited range of applications since they touch on so many aspects of business operations, the person in charge of AI or the metaverse needs to be something of a Renaissance (wo)man. Not only do they need to build teams with a wide range of technical and vertical skill sets, they also need to navigate the complex organizational politics of having such a wide-roving brief. Digital generated image of young woman jumping out from portal gate and being scattered to ... [+] particles. Metaverse concept. For example, will this person have responsibility for internal investments and external partnerships? How much control do they get over setting and spending budgets? Who reports to them and to whom do they report? How does this reshape the chain of command? These are just some of the questions to consider when fitting new technology into existing corporate structures. They are also key considerations when selecting who will be in charge. Following President Biden’s executive order on AI, many federal agencies are now required to name a CAIO, responsible for promoting AI and managing its risks and rewards. If the government installs CAIOs, we can be sure that major businesses will follow suit. But what will these people actually do? At the federal level, CAIOs will “spearhead internal policy decisions, regulations and workforce recruitment to implement and utilize AI tools effectively.” In the corporate world, however, whoever’s in charge of AI and metaverse initiatives will have a much more varied and indeed challenging set of responsibilities. Cathy Hackl, known to many as the “godmother of the metaverse” and a former chief metaverse officer, explains how hard it is to pin down these roles. “Every day is different, and you never know what challenges are going to land in your inbox,” she told me. “The only thing that never really changes is that my role requires me to be an evangelist and educator. I spend a lot of my time traveling, presenting and speaking—both at industry events and internally at my company.” Cathy Hackl is known to many as the “godmother of the metaverse.” Hackl added, “I work across practically every line of business, so it’s a big challenge to be thoroughly on top of the detail about each department. I need to ensure I understand what their goals are, and they need to know how new technology can help accomplish them. But there’s also a lot of roll-your-sleeves-up, down-and-dirty work with the technology itself, whether it’s designing virtual components or shepherding implementation projects.” If that sounds like a lot to have on your plate, it barely scratches the surface of the challenges ahead. Take ethics, for example. As the Women Leaders in Data and AI’s Executive Champion Award 2023, this is a particularly strong focus for me. The overarching challenge is how to integrate AI in the corporate world, drive innovation, and try not to slow down any implementation timelines, all while being completely ethical, transparent and honest. Whose role is it to predict unforeseen risks that any implementation could contain, and to handle change management? Who’s responsible for making sure that no one is disadvantaged by new technologies—so often designed and built by white men—and guard against unwitting discrimination? It may be that the most valuable CxO for your business reputation is actually a chief ethics officer rather than a head of metaverse. None of this is to deny that the roles I mentioned at the beginning of this article have enormous potential value, and could be transformative for your organization. It is to point out that there’s a huge amount of preparatory work to do before you order those new business cards. In any technological revolution, one of the most difficult things to resist is the urge to jump on the bandwagon so as not to be left behind. My advice? Let fools rush in and make their own mistakes. This opportunity is far too precious to waste, so take your time to think about what you want to achieve rather than what you’re going to name the role.  "},

The paper analyzes the impact of technological progress on output and wages, considering the possibility of full automation and its implications for the labor market. The authors discuss the race between automation and capital accumulation, the effects on wage dynamics, and the potential for broad-based gains in productivity. The research provides valuable insights into the economic consequences of AGI development. The transition to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has been a topic of great interest and speculation in recent years. Many researchers and industry leaders believe that AGI, which refers to AI systems that can perform all tasks at human levels, may soon become a reality. In a working paper titled \"Scenarios for the Transition to AGI,\" economists Anton Korinek and Donghyun Suh delve into the economic implications of AGI development. The paper starts by examining the relationship between technological progress, output, and wages. The authors propose a framework that decomposes human work into atomistic tasks with varying levels of complexity. They argue that advances in technology enable the automation of increasingly complex tasks, potentially leading to the automation of all tasks with the advent of AGI. One crucial aspect analyzed in the paper is the race between automation and capital accumulation. If automation progresses slowly enough, there will always be enough work for humans, and wages may continue to rise. However, if the complexity of tasks that humans can perform is bounded and full automation is achieved, wages may collapse. The authors also consider the possibility of declines in wages before full automation occurs if large-scale automation outpaces capital accumulation, leading to an oversupply of labor. The research suggests that the automation of productivity growth can result in broad-based gains in the returns to all factors of production. On the other hand, bottlenecks to growth caused by scarce, irreproducible factors may exacerbate the decline in wages. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding the distribution of tasks in complexity space and its impact on economic outcomes. While the paper provides valuable insights into the potential consequences of AGI development, it also acknowledges the uncertainties surrounding the transition. The authors highlight that the distribution of tasks in complexity space plays a crucial role in determining the economic outcomes. They consider both unbounded and bounded distributions, with the latter reflecting the finite computational capabilities of the human brain. Overall, the research by Korinek and Suh contributes to the ongoing discussion about the future of work in the age of AI and automation. By analyzing different scenarios for the transition to AGI, the paper sheds light on the possible effects on output, wages, and human welfare. It serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders seeking to understand the economic implications of AGI development. "},

For decades, policymakers have tried to curb big tech’s growing influence on our lives, from the government’s antitrust case against Microsoft MSFT for its anticompetitive behavior against Netscape in the browser market in the late 1990s, to the FTC challenging the acquisitions of Instagram and Whatsapp by Meta, Amazon’s AMZN practices with its sellers and customers, Apple’s recent $2 billion EU fine for its conduct against Spotify, and now the new DOJ case against Apple AAPL . Unfortunately, in all these cases, antitrust enforcement and fines have been extremely ineffective. Similarly, well-intentioned rules, like GDPR, backfired by raising compliance costs, thus aiding established firms and hindering new privacy-centric players. Even when they don’t backfire, regulations in this area run into all sorts of implementation challenges. While the key objective of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) is directionally correct—to prevent companies that have become gatekeepers in so many of our economic and social interactions to abuse their dominant position—its execution leaves plenty of room for incumbents to stall, whether it’s in the name of privacy, security or technical complexity. Bill Gates of Microsoft, Scott McNeally of Sun Microsystems and Jim Barksdale of Netscape ... [+] Communications at a Senate hearing on antitrust issues. The truth is that Microsoft Internet Explorer was not defeated by large antitrust fines or by giving consumers the option to choose a browser in Windows, but by the world moving on with mobile devices and Microsoft missing that wave of innovation. Fundamentally, it's through the same innovative forces that created these extremely successful companies that competition can be brought back. And it is the policymakers who determine if that happens. Innovation that is truly disruptive requires an architectural rewiring of how problems are solved, and that sparks the need for new regulation. When faced with a novel technological paradigm, policymakers can make one of two major mistakes: regulate too early, or wait for too long. When regulation is too rigid, too early, it is equivalent to picking winners at a time when the landscape is still uncertain. So it should come as no surprise that this approach never works. A recent example is the executive order on AI issued by President Biden. This order appears to be more driven by fear than by technical considerations. For example, it sets thresholds based on the number of floating-point operations to determine the level of regulation for AI projects. Because the thresholds are arbitrary, they will either be irrelevant, or in the worst case, actually detrimental to AI development in the United States. When regulation arrives too late instead, policymakers push the best innovators out by failing to provide them with clarity. That’s what is happening in the United States with crypto, and comes at the risk of the country squandering its lead. It also ironically helps projects that are comfortable breaking the law, as we have seen with the FTX scandal. The excuse, at least from the SEC, is that rules written in 1933 and a framework for financial markets designed when we relied on open outcry trading, physical stock certificates and prices rolled out on ticker tape do not need any updating. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler speaks at a Senate hearing on market ... [+] regulation. Regulation that arrives too late or too early protects incumbents. And it's hard to blame policymakers, as their incentives are not aligned. Unlike venture capitalists, who enjoy massive upside on success and limited downside on failure, regulators and policymakers get little credit when things go well, and all the blame when they don’t. The decision by the U.S. government to not over-regulate the internet drove decades of economic growth, but few likely remember the names of those involved in it. As a result, the typical regulatory “portfolio” is filled with safe but mediocre bets. The exceptions are moments in history where governments had the courage to propel their nations forward, from the Marshall Plan, to China’s economic reform, the space race, the EU single market, and more. President Kennedy gives remarks at Rice University in 1962. Today we are at a similar juncture for all of our digital infrastructure: from AI and robotics, to financial services and digital marketplaces, if the United States wants to continue to lead, it needs to create the right conditions for competition to thrive. Like in the early days of the internet, this starts with policymakers embracing and nurturing a novel architecture based on open protocols. But how can open protocols limit the power of big tech intermediaries and accelerate a new wave of innovation? In Latin, intermediary means “in the middle.” Intermediation can be extremely helpful to society, and many transactions would never exist without intermediaries. But when intermediaries accumulate too much power, they not only capture all of the value they create, but also slow down progress. Unfortunately, accumulating power is a natural result of being an intermediary: When you’re in the middle, you have access to better information than either side, can decide on what terms others participate, and shape interactions to your advantage. As a result, historically we’ve alternated between the rise of new intermediaries, and the subsequent push to remove them from their privileged position. So what is an effective approach to rein in powerful intermediaries? You need to find an alternative way to connect the two sides of the market. Sometimes the government may regulate away the intermediaries’ most outrageous behaviors or become a benevolent (but inefficient) intermediary. Sometimes technology surprises us all with something much better: interoperability. In latin, interoperability means “to work between.” Which makes it clear why interoperability is the best antidote to someone standing in the middle. We’ve seen this all before. Because the internet was built on open and interoperable protocols, it was a strong decentralizing force and decreased the power of intermediaries across a range of industries. It also created the conditions for new and more powerful intermediaries to emerge from marketplaces and payments, to messaging and social media, the creator economy, etc. Propelled by the need to monetize the fast-growing networks they created, internet-based intermediaries proceeded to limit interoperability and constrained consumers and businesses within their walled gardens. People at the Apple Store at Grand Central Terminal in New York City. Today, their walls define how businesses surface products to their customers, developers distribute their apps, how we interact with our social network, how creators connect to their audiences, and a lot more. By controlling access, the underlying data, and the algorithms that rank results and match buyers and sellers, each one of these platforms shapes how society allocates attention, effort and money. Without a change in direction, AI will only make this worse, since it builds on the advantage these companies have established across data, compute, and distribution channels. Interoperability fixes this. Imagine a world where you can send and receive messages irrespective of the messaging app you use. Same with sending and receiving money, reading updates from your social or news feed, finding the right product or service, or interacting with an AI agent. On a truly interoperable network consumers and businesses have actual leverage against intermediaries, as they can port their business elsewhere without having to rebuild their audience, social graph, or customer base. Developers also won’t worry about their platform becoming a competitor overnight. By injecting interoperability into our digital interactions, open protocols unravel the advantage tech companies have established over the last decades, and force them to compete again. This, in turn, drives the type of innovation that helped the United States lead in the early days of the internet. The time to act on crypto regulation is now. However, for any of this to materialize, regulators must first establish a framework that allows the new open protocols enabled by cryptocurrencies to thrive. With regards to everything from securities laws and financial market infrastructure to stablecoins, the time to act on crypto regulation is now. Otherwise, these protocols and the economic growth they promise will develop elsewhere. The impact of these developments extends well beyond financial services. These open protocols, which are gradually rewiring our financial system, have the potential to reshape competition in AI, digital platforms and infrastructure. Entrepreneurs and developers are already at work. However, much like in the internet’s early days, their ventures will not succeed without the right regulatory framework.  "},

By submitting an amicus brief, John Deaton, a Republican lawyer and candidate for the Senate, has shown his support for Coinbase in the legal conflict that the company is now engaged in with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Throughout this brief, Deaton makes the case that a higher court need to take into consideration a significant legal question that pertains to the regulation of cryptocurrencies. Not only does his participation in this case serve as evidence of his dedication to the bitcoin community, but it also serves to bolster his position as a candidate who supports cryptocurrencies in the forthcoming competition for the Senate. In support of Coinbase's appeal, the company has filed a request for an interlocutory appeal, which seeks to have a higher court decide whether or not digital assets that are exchanged on secondary markets should be regulated as securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Deaton's amicus brief provides support for Coinbase's stance by contesting the SEC's wide application of the Howey test, which determines what constitutes an investment contract, to identify all token transactions as securities. This test is used to establish what constitutes an investment contract. Given the variety and complexity of digital assets and the transactions that take place between them across various blockchain platforms, he contends that an all-encompassing approach is not feasible. The participation of John Deaton in this case further reinforces his image as a pro-crypto candidate in the forthcoming Senate campaign. Deaton's commitment to the cryptocurrency community is a testament to his dedication to the cryptocurrency community. As a result of his prior support for Ripple Labs in their legal struggle against the SEC, he has established his reputation and shown his dedication to the digital asset industry. Furthermore, Deaton is expected to deliver a speech at the Consensus 2024 conference, which will showcase his active participation in participating in talks about crypto-regulatory issues. Regardless of the result of the election, it is probable that his continuous engagement in key crypto-regulatory matters will increase his influence in the industry. There are substantial repercussions for the Senate campaign as a result of John Deaton's backing for Coinbase in its legal struggle against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He is a strong pro-crypto candidate due to his dedication to the cryptocurrency ecosystem as well as his active participation in debates on crypto-regulatory issues. His support for Coinbase and other crypto-related issues is likely to connect with voters who are interested in the future of blockchain technology and digital assets, despite the fact that he is facing a hard battle against the incumbent Senator Elizabeth Warren.

Anyone who tells you bitcoin’s volatility is a negative is foolish. Speculators and those folks who have driven the fascination with crypto love volatility. People love to gamble and if you take that away from an asset it becomes a dull backwater. If you are reading this you are unlikely to be a blue chip “widows and orphans” type of investor. While volatility kills it also thrills! So what do you know, bitcoin has thrown a mighty tantrum, for the hundredth time. That is totally predictable, but what isn’t is what happens next. Here I outlined the roadmap and series of charts to help navigate this cycle end rally. Using classic charting used in post war boom markets, we are in a period of equilibrium, typified by this chart from a few days ago: The bitcoin chart a few days ago: a period of equilibrium And here we are: The current bitcoin chart So the call when you hit these “equilibrium” points is: ‘Is it over or is it half way?’ It’s a quirk of probability, but that’s a tried and tested check for me based on random walk maths. So the only call is represented by this chart: The bitcoin chart: will it go sideways or up? So let’s go back to the basic premise of repeating patterns: The bitcoin chart's repeating patterns So I think I do not need to say much more. If this rally is half way, the theoretical top is $100,000 or so. If not it’s back to $40,000. Therefore I’m using the box as guide rails to keep track of the action. The above chart is very compelling to me, but that is no reason to be bitcoin-maxi complacent. A repeating pattern needs a repeating process, and in this ever-changing world we live in patterns can change. For now at least we remain in bounds. We are days away from the halving, but that is no finishing post; in fact, in the past there has been a lag between the cut in new bitcoin production and a rally, so it remains the case that holders need to watch and wait or take their profits and retire off to count them. I generally bail early but to me we still have a final leg to go. This is not fate but an opinion and in these market verticals it is extremely difficult to know when the party is over, but for now the music is still playing and it is time to look for opportunities that could balloon on any last leg move. To me that might be ordinals and runes on the bitcoin chain, so it is time to go skill up on them, because in crypto it is in obscurity that the big returns lay.

UK Finance, a pivotal entity in the banking and finance sector of the United Kingdom, has initiated an experimental phase to delve into the capabilities and benefits of the UK Regulated Liability Network (RLN). This innovative phase involves a strategic partnership with eleven member organizations, aiming to unlock new possibilities in digital transactions and finance management through the RLN. The experiments conducted under this initiative will scrutinize three distinct use cases: payment-upon-delivery for physical products, improvements in the homebuying process, and digital bond settlement. These cases are chosen to address specific challenges in the current financial ecosystem, ranging from online transaction fraud to inefficiencies in property transactions and bond settlements. This use case is designed to combat fraud in online transactions by ensuring that payments are made only when the physical product is successfully delivered. By leveraging the capabilities of the RLN, this approach promises to bolster security and trust in e-commerce, offering a more reliable shopping experience for consumers. Focusing on the real estate sector, this use case aims at enhancing transparency for customers and reducing conveyance fraud, a prevalent issue where deceit is used to evade creditor claims. The RLN's application in this area is expected to provide a secure and transparent platform for property transactions, significantly mitigating risks associated with property dealings. The third use case explores the use of digital money for settling digital bonds. By incorporating the RLN, this initiative seeks to streamline the settlement process, potentially reducing costs and improving operational efficiency in financial markets. The experimental phase of the RLN is closely aligned with Project Rosalind, a collaborative initiative between the Bank for International Settlements and the Bank of England. Project Rosalind is focused on developing an application programming interface (API) for a potential digital pound. The RLN experiments are set to explore foundational capabilities that ensure compatibility and interoperability with future digital currency initiatives, thereby paving the way for more integrated and efficient financial operations. The collaboration between UK Finance and its member organizations through the RLN experiments marks a significant step towards modernizing the financial landscape of the UK. By addressing critical issues through tailored use cases and aligning with broader digital currency projects like Project Rosalind, the initiative not only promises enhanced operational efficiencies but also positions the UK at the forefront of financial innovation. As these experiments unfold, the outcomes are expected to contribute substantially to the shaping of a safer, more transparent, and efficient financial future. "},

Several exchanges, including Cboe Exchange, Inc., BOX Exchange LLC, MIAX International Securities Exchange LLC, Nasdaq ISE, LLC, and NYSE American LLC, have submitted requests to enable options trading on recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. Nasdaq's application would list and trade options tied to BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, while Cboe intends to facilitate options trading across a spectrum of ETPs holding Bitcoin. Interested parties are invited to submit their initial comments within 21 days following the official registration of the document, with the final deadline set for May 15, 2024. The SEC is also questioning whether options trading on spot Bitcoin ETFs should adhere to the same regulations as stocks. This includes considering whether options on Bitcoin ETFs should be subject to the same position limits as options on stock and whether the available supply in the markets for Bitcoin should be considered in establishing position limits for options on Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC has previously solicited feedback on the proposed rule change and has incorporated the received commentary in its filing. Most of the comments highlighted the potential benefits of introducing options on Bitcoin ETFs, citing enhanced liquidity and bolstered market efficiency. However, the decision-making process regarding options trading has faced delays, with the SEC extending the review period for allowing options trading on Grayscale and Bitwise Bitcoin ETFs, setting a new decision date for May 29, 2024. Asset management firms such as Bitwise and Grayscale are actively pursuing regulatory clearance to list options on their Bitcoin ETFs through applications to the New York Stock Exchange. These firms believe that options trading on spot Bitcoin ETFs could provide investors with hedging strategies and risk management tools. They draw parallels to the approval process for options on spot gold ETPs following their initial approval. "},

Zhao, 47, pleaded guilty last November to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act, agreeing that he failed to implement an effective anti-money laundering (AML) program at Binance in the early days of the exchange. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has asked the judge to impose a three year prison sentence – double the 18-month maximum established by the sentencing guidelines and harsher than comparable sentences, which often result in a sentence of probation or time served. In their sentencing memo filed last week, Zhao’s lawyers pointed out several cases where a violation of the BSA resulted in probation-only sentences, including the 2014 case U.S. v. Miller, in which a CEO of a domestic financial institution was sentenced to probation for failing to implement an effective AML program or file suspicious activity reports (SARs). Zhao’s lawyers have recommended that their client be sentenced to probation, not jail – a sentence which would closely mirror that of BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who pleaded guilty to the same crime in 2022 and was sentenced to six months of house arrest and two years of probation. “This is a high-profile case, to be sure. But Mr. Zhao is not a symbol,” Zhao’s lawyers argued. “He is a devoted father, a philanthropist… He has already shown remorse for his offense and, more importantly, has remediated.” The 161 letters filed with the court served to back up Zhao’s lawyers claims, but also provide an unprecedented glimpse into the private life and personal history of the notoriously private Binance founder. Zhao, now worth over $40 billion according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, was once a first-generation immigrant to Canada who was the poorest in his high school friend group and worked part-time at McDonald’s “to support his family and to have spare allowance to spend,\" Ted Lin, a high school friend and later colleague at Binance, said in his letter. His friends from high school recall Zhao as a top student and formidable athlete, who became captain of the school volleyball team after teaching himself how to play the sport by reading library books on the subject, Lin’s letter said Letters to the court also revealed Zhao to be the father of five children – two adult children from his marriage to Weiqing “Winnie” Yang, who are both currently enrolled at U.S. universities, and three young children with Binance co-founder and current partner Yi He. According to both Zhao’s current and former partners, he is a devoted father. In her letter to the court, Zhao’s wife Yang said that, even when Binance was going through massive growth, he took the time to spend time with his adolescent children, flying to see them in Tokyo when they had issues in school and going camping in the Japanese countryside with his middle school-aged son during Boy Scout trips. Yang also celebrated her estranged husband’s philanthropy – including donations to earthquake victims in Turkey and building schools in Africa, saying “he has done so many things that he may not even remember them.” He, his current partner, said her children are “very close” to Zhao, and have suffered from his absence over the past five and a half months. “Now they are always asking: Why isn’t Dad home? When can Dad come back?,” He wrote. He also told the court about Zhao’s disinterest in luxury goods – something that was also mentioned by many of the Binance co-founder’s other family members, friends and colleagues. “He knows nothing about the jewelry, luxury goods, luxury cars, and art auctions that rich people are passionate about,” He wrote, adding that Zhao purchases his clothes on Amazon, rides a scooter to meetings and drives a Toyota minivan. Another friend of Zhao’s recollected visiting him at home in 2021, when crypto trading volumes were hitting all-time highs, and being surprised to find him “living under his means” in a three-bedroom apartment in Singapore strewn with children's toys and operating Binance from his dining room table. The description of Zhao’s purported “apathy toward hedonism,” as another friend described it, mirrors similar claims by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s family and friends ahead of his sentencing. In their own letters to the judge, Bankman-Fried’s family attempted to paint the disgraced former FTX CEO as completely uninterested in wealth or luxury or the company of celebrities that were paid to endorse his company. The judge was apparently unconvinced, and sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison for his crimes. Whether or not the judge in Zhao’s case will feel differently will be determined tomorrow, though Zhao's case has other differences. Bankman-Fried did not accept responsibility or show remorse, according to the judge overseeing his case, while Zhao pleaded guilty last year. The charges are also different; Zhao's exchange never filed for bankruptcy and is continuing to operate today, while Bankman-Fried's notably saw customers worldwide lose access to around $8 billion in funds.

Nansen data showed that the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, Tether, processed $654 billion in the past 30 days, while DAI managed over $394 billion of flows and USDC saw $321 billion in trading volume. \"The total for the three at $1.369 trillion is higher than the monthly average for market leader Visa in 2023,\" said Nansen. That compares to $1.23 trillion, the monthly average of Visa's yearly $14.8 trillion volume in 2023. Transaction volume in the past 30 days for Tether, USDC, and DAI, has surpassed Visa's 2023 monthly average. Image: Nansen Nansen’s data showed that Tether alone processed nearly as much in monthly volumes as Mastercard, the second largest card provider in the world. Mastercard’s monthly average volumes were $750 billion in 2023, totaling $9 trillion for the year. Data showed that Tether also outstripped PayPal, which managed $125 billion on average each month last year. In an April report, Visa claimed that Circle’s USDC should be classed as the leading stablecoin in terms of transactions volume. Visa said it cleansed stablecoin transaction data of inorganic activity and only counted the largest stablecoin amount transferred within a single transaction to show USDC surpassing its market contenders. Transaction volumes for USDC surpass those for USDT when adjusted for the Visa report: Image: Allium data. According to the report, the removal of bot activity, complex smart contract interaction and automatic transactions from centralized exchanges, saw USDC transaction volume surpass that for USDT on a weekly basis. \"Only transactions that have been sent by an account that has initiated less than 1,000 stablecoin transactions and $10 million in transfer volume, over last 30 days, are counted. This removes various bot activity as well as automatic transactions from large entities like centralized exchanges,\" the report said.

Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded near $62,400 at press time, down 2.5% on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk Indices data. Ether (ETH) traded 3% lower at $3,200, and the CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the most liquid digital assets, was down 2.6% at 2,197 points. The market appears to be on a precipice right now as it debates which direction to take, with significant bullish and bearish narratives on the horizon. As QCP wrote in a note over the weekend, the threat of stagflation – a period of high inflation and low growth – is very real. \"The weaker than expected [U.S.] GDP print points to a more sluggish economy while the higher Core PCE warns of an inflation problem that continues to be a thorn in the Fed's side,\" QCP wrote. Last week's U.S. GDP report showed the world's largest economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the first quarter of this year following the preceding quarter's 3.4% growth. Meanwhile, the personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation metric, showed prices rose to a 3.4% annualized rate in the first three months of the year from 1.8% in the final quarter of 2023. The stagflationary combination of slower growth rate and sticky inflation has further weakened the probability of the Fed rate cuts. Most traders on the prediction market platform Polymarket still see no rate cuts as the most likely scenario, with a 35% chance of this happening, but the chance of 1 rate cut is creeping up, now at 29% versus 26% a week ago and 14% at the start of the month. QCP also wrote that Janet Yellen's fiscal strategy, leveraging the Treasury General Account (TGA)—holding close to USD 1 trillion in assets—and the Reverse Repurchase Program (RRP) with USD 400 billion, could inject up to $1.4 trillion in liquidity into the financial system pushing up all risk assets. As CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole wrote last week, the key to a continuing bitcoin bull market is the U.S. Treasury's impending quarterly refunding announcement, which maintains or reduces the current TGA balance of $750 billion. This $750 billion figure in the TGA is key because it serves as a significant signal to financial markets about the U.S. government's fiscal intentions, profoundly impacting economic stability and growth. Meanwhile, the launch of the bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong on April 30 is also catching the eye of traders. However, news that mainland Chinese investors won't be able to trade the ETFs has dialed down the bullishness of the launch. "},

Bitcoin had slumped as low as $59,685 on Friday before rebounding above $65,000.

But this time, bitcoin has already embarked on a momentous rally to record highs, rising from $15,500 in late 2022 to $73,680, helped by optimism around the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and then then the ensuing enthusiasm after they began trading in January. On Thursday, JPMorgan said that it expected bitcoin to drop following the halving as it remained in \"overbought conditions\" based on the high level of open interest in bitcoin futures. Goldman Sachs added that in order for bitcoin to emulate the success of previous cycles following halving events, macro conditions need to be supportive of risk-taking.

A sell-off on April 12 from $71,000 to $60,000 wiped out $4 billion in open interest from the bitcoin market, according to Coinalyze. The figure across all exchanges excluding CME is $16.1 billion.

This roundup is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package. Fran Finney, his widow, will accept the inaugural Finney Freedom Prize on Hal’s behalf and plans to donate the monetary prize of 1 bitcoin (BTC) to a yet-unnamed charity. Hal Finney died in 2014 due to complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. HRF Chief Strategy Officer Alex Gladstein said the award is meant to honor those who make vital contributions to Bitcoin. “Obviously we can't give it to Satoshi. So, beyond that, it's Hal. No one even comes close to his contributions,” Gladstein told CoinDesk in an interview. “He coded until his last days. I mean, he literally contributed to human freedom until his muscles didn't cooperate anymore.” Read more: Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto? “Hal would have been thrilled to see how this Bitcoin ecosystem has grown, and to learn that this once-obscure software project is now used by tens of millions of people worldwide,” Fran Finney said in a pre-recorded acceptance speech. “He would be honored to be the first recipient of this award, and humbled to have it be in his name. I feel great privilege and responsibility in accepting the first prize on his behalf.” The Human Rights Foundation has set aside an additional 32 bitcoin, worth over $2 million at current prices, out of its own treasury to make awards well into the future. “Our view is that in 40 years, it'll probably be the world's largest cash prize,” Gladstein said. For the next three years, the foundation will name a new laureate on Jan. 10, also known as “Running Bitcoin Day,” or the day Hal Finney posted on Twitter (now X) about becoming the first person besides Satoshi Nakamoto to download the Bitcoin software. After that, the awards will be handed out to coincide with Bitcoin halvings, approximately every four years. (The next one happens in a few hours from press time.) Read more: This Bitcoin Halving Is Different. But Is It 'Priced In'? The first four awards, including Finney’s, are meant specifically to retroactively reward those who made the biggest contributions to Bitcoin within the periods between each of the first four halvings: 2009-2012 (Finney), 2012-2016, 2016-2020 and 2020-2024. After that, the prize will go to those who contribute most in the intervening four years. A “Genesis Committee” of seven individuals – including “The Genesis Book” author Aaron van Wirdum, Africa Bitcoin Conference founder Farida Nabourema, Bitcoin Core dev Gloria Zhao, bitcoin++ and Base58 co-founder Lisa Neigut, Fedi founder Obi Nwosu, Stone Ridge Holdings CEO Ross Stevens and Running Bitcoin Challenge co-founder Vitus Zeller – was picked to lead the nomination process until 2028. Committee members will then nominate their successor, who will serve a four-year term. “This is a prize that will outlast us all,” Gladstein said, noting that the last Bitcoin halving will take place sometime in the next century. “Hopefully we can have some kind of intellectual lineage here going through the decades. The first seven are only going to choose somebody who they really feel embodies their ideals so hopefully you get a committee in 100 years that's somewhat reflective of the initial committee.” Even if Hal Finney had never discovered Bitcoin on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, becoming the first person to receive a bitcoin transaction and contribute code to the project, it’s likely he would be remembered by the Bitcoin community for his many contributions to cryptography and his privacy advocacy A graduate of the California Institute of Technology, Finney began to make contributions to foundational cryptographic communications tool Pretty Good Privacy (better known as PGP) in the early 1990s, before working for the PGP Corp. directly until retirement. The program remains one of the best ways to encrypt online communications. “The work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother obsolete,” he wrote to a group of cryptographers, at a time when the U.S. government was looking to limit the public’s access to strong encryption. Finney’s work on PGP led to his interest in digital currencies, which he thought could better protect people’s privacy than the emerging payment options like credit cards that were beginning to dominate (and still dominate) the web. In 2004, Finney created a prototype digital asset that reusable proof-of-work system, which although it didn’t catch on, went on to directly inspire Bitcoin. See also: Bitcoin and the Rise of the Cypherpunks Four years later, when Satoshi unveiled the Bitcoin white paper, Finney was one of a few people who took notice. He responded on Satoshi’s announcement post on the cryptography mailing list that he looked forward to seeing how the concept would be developed and was offered early access to the project source code. Between 2009 and 2013, when Finney announced he was paralyzed on the BitcoinTalk forum, he made several key contributions to the Bitcoin software. Throughout his life he was a frequent marathon runner, alongside his wife Fran. In a 2009 Less Wrong blog post, Finney wrote “my dream is to contribute to open source software projects even from within an immobile body.” There are some who believe that Finney is Satoshi, or a possible contributor to a group that referred to itself under the collective name. A recent post by Bitcoin OG Jameson Lopp disputes this claim, after reviewing timestamps that show Finney was often probably elsewhere while Satoshi was online. Finney himself denied that he was Satoshi Nakamoto. “We wanted to do the prize not just to honor Hal’s contributions to Bitcoin, but digital privacy and freedom generally,” Gladstein said. “It is something that is very important to us.” "},

The closure has sparked debate among the crypto community, with Bitcoin and Ether trading down. The bank had approximately $6 billion in total assets and $4 billion in total deposits as of January 31. The closure of Republic First Bank, a regional lender that had operations in the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, was a major event involving the regulatory authorities . In the year 2024, its shutdown represents the first collapse of a financial institution in the United States. As of the 31st of January, the bank, which was operating under the name Republic Bank, had around $6 billion in total assets and $4 billion in total deposits [2]. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities was the one who initiated the closure of Republic First Bank, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was named as the receiver of the bank. Fulton Bank, which has its headquarters in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, has reached an agreement to buy almost all of the assets of the failing bank and to take over a significant portion of the financial institution's deposits. It is expected that the 32 branches of Republic Bank will reopen as branches of Fulton Bank as early as Saturday, which would ensure that clients will continue to get financial services. Depositors of Republic Bank will be transferred to Fulton Bank, and they will not be required to make any changes to their banking relationship in order to keep their deposit insurance coverage. Depositors of Republic First Bank have the ability to retrieve their cash via cheques or automated teller machines as early as Friday night. It is anticipated that the deposit insurance fund would incur a loss of $667 million as a result of the collapse of Republic First Bank. Bitcoin and Ether have both seen a decline in price as a result of the collapse of Republic First Bank, which has caused controversy and anxiety within the cryptocurrency community. It is possible that the liquidation of a conventional bank may result in an upsurge in interest in decentralised finance and cryptocurrencies as prospective alternatives to established financial institutions. There has been an increase in the financial risks that many regional and community banks are facing as a result of rising interest rates and dropping commercial real estate prices. This is especially true for office buildings that have been impacted by the surge in vacancy rates associated with the epidemic. It has become difficult for financial institutions to refinance their loan portfolios and manage their loan portfolios as a result of outstanding loans that are secured by assets that have lost value.

Rodamor is known for the release of Ordinals, a protocol that allows people to “inscribe” data on the smallest units of bitcoin (i.e. satoshis) to create highly valued assets on Bitcoin. Ordinals is largely credited for inspiring a renewed developer ecosystem on Bitcoin. Runes is similar to Ordinals, in that it allows people to “etch” and mint tokens on-chain – the main difference is that ordinals are “non-fungible” (i.e. one-of-a-kind) while Runes will function more like meme coins, which have recently taken crypto markets by storm. The first Runes project to mint was Rodamor’s own UNCOMMON•GOODS project, which was announced well in advance of the halving, as were many of the projects looking to etch themselves on these highly coveted satoshis. See also: The Bitcoin Halving Is Here, and With It a Giant Surge in Transaction Fees Impossible to know in advance, however, is what other projects would be able to find space on these scarce satoshis. There are already quite literally hundreds of Runes projects that are currently being minted and looking for prospective buyers. About nine blocks after the halving, Runes minters had already paid 78.6 BTC in fees (~$4.95 million) in order to buy the rarest of the rare. This suggests that, like Ordinals, the Runes protocol could be a boon to Bitcoin’s burgeoning fee economy. What makes a Runes project potentially viable is something of a subjective measure: being an early project to list — like DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON, which has the honor of being “Rune Number 3” — is one measure. But buyers are also judging projects based on the “quality” of its ticker. A number of Runes projects were already starting to mint before the halving happened, including DOG•DOG•DOG•DOG•DOG, MEME•ECONOMICS, SHORT•THE•WORLD and PEPE•WIT•HONKERS, including dozens others, according to runebtc.xyz. Prior to the halving block being mined, prospective buyers in an X Space hosted by Leonidas, a well-regarded Ordinals collector, users and speculators alike were discussing which Runes to mint and trading ticker names. Among the names dropped were Taproot Wizards, the Ordinals project co-created by Bitcoin OG influencers Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, and a project called Satoshi Nakamoto, named after Bitcoin’s creator, which at press time had over 5,000 holders who minted about 19,000 tokens. Which projects will actually prove to have long term value is hard to judge. “Yeah, I don't see any good memes, like, I mean, I'm just trying to figure it out,” one trader said. “To be quite frank, I haven’t minted anything yet.” See also: Runes DEX Secures $2 Million in Seed Investment to Pioneer AMM on Bitcoin “I’m trying to understand the space in general right now,” someone else responded. “These projects are like early Runes. Do you guys think that these are actually going to be the most valuable ones?” “I think it depends what happens with them,” someone responded. Another aspect to consider: how many of the tokens were “pre-mined,” or held in reserve for project creators to potentially release on the market later. Prior to the halving, Leonidas shared guidelines that suggested projects that pre-mine more than 10% of the token supply were “greedy.” “I think the pre-mines are going to be the ones that win,” one trader said. “Because like, it's so hard to come up with a good meme with a 13 character limit,” he said, referring to the hardcoded naming system Rodamor added to Runes to try to prevent “ticker squatters.” In time, Runes tickers will be able to list with shorter names. Within three years, there could be Runes projects with three-letter tickers, for instance. Though it’s unclear how well this strategy will play out. According to data source Ordiscan, one forethinking developer has already blocked off a series of tickers, including ZZZZ (which will be the “first four letter Rune” to mint in two years), ZZ and Z (the first two letter and one letter Runes to mint in three years) and A (the last single character Rune to mint in four years). In other words, with something so new, it’s hard to determine what to value. “As everybody is scrambling to figure out what the hell's going on, I want to just take a moment to say it's awesome being here with all of you,” Leonidas told his audience. “This is essentially the start of a new protocol that kicked off about 30 minutes ago. So let's see what happens. I think it's going to be very chaotic.”  "},

By incorporating crypto payments, businesses signal their commitment to innovation and their recognition of emerging market trends. This strategic expansion broadens the scope of clientele accessibility, as it caters to a technologically savvy generation that prefers the efficiency and privacy offered by blockchain-based transactions. Moreover, it positions businesses at the forefront of a burgeoning financial paradigm, ensuring they remain competitive in a rapidly evolving digital economy. In the digital economy, websites that incorporate cryptocurrency transactions tend to resonate with a growing demographic of tech-aware users. This clientele values both innovation and privacy when engaging in online commerce. Recognizing this group's proclivities, businesses that pivot to accept crypto payments are perceived as forward-thinking and trustworthy. They demonstrate an understanding of market evolution, positioning themselves favorably in the competitive landscape. Embracing cryptocurrencies equates to valuing customer choice and financial innovation. By speaking directly to the needs of crypto-savvy customers, websites broaden their reach and relevance. They align themselves with a cohort that champions technological progress (often with substantial spending power), increasing opportunities for revenue and dynamic market engagement. Incorporating cryptocurrency payments is a strategic move that can enhance the resilience of your revenue model. A diversified revenue stream assists in cushioning economic fluctuations, providing a steadier financial footing for your business. Crypto payments not only add robustness to your revenue streams but also position your website at the forefront of financial innovation and customer-centric services. When integrating cryptocurrency payments into your website, you're tapping into a cornerstone advantage that often goes underappreciated: significantly reduced transaction costs. Traditional payment gateways typically exert a substantial financial burden through fees, slicing into profit margins. However, crypto transactions, by their decentralized and peer-to-peer nature, sidestep many of the costly intermediaries, passing on a leaner cost structure to merchants. A good crypto payment gateway however, allows you to accept bitcoin and other cryptos much easier than doing it yourself, and they charge only about 1% in fees. This efficient fee model lends itself to increased profitability, enabling businesses to reinvest savings into growth or offer more competitive pricing to their customers—an enticing prospect for any enterprise eyeing long-term fiscal health. Implementing crypto payments can result in substantial operational cost reductions for businesses, as traditional financial infrastructures often incur hefty maintenance and transactional fees, which can be mitigated by blockchain solutions. By employing cryptocurrencies, businesses can bypass many conventional banking expenses, such as account maintenance fees, wire transfer fees, and overdraft charges. The automation potential with smart contracts and streamlined settlement improves operational efficiency, further curtailing costs. Additionally, crypto payments shield businesses from the volatility of currency exchange rates and international transaction fees. When operating globally, these factors can significantly impact profit margins, but cryptocurrencies largely operate independently of such fiscal variances. Embracing cryptocurrency payments, therefore, presents an opportunity for businesses to optimize their financial strategy by cutting operational overhead, and that efficiency can translate into competitive pricing and improved margins. Adopting cryptocurrency payments can significantly mitigate the risks of chargebacks that businesses face. Chargebacks can be a costly and time-consuming ordeal, draining resources and accumulating unnecessary expenses. Implementing a crypto payment structure not only diminishes chargeback occurrences but also streamlines the transaction dispute resolution process. Cryptocurrency transactions leverage advanced cryptographic techniques that safeguard against data tampering, ensuring payers' and payees' security. In essence, cryptographic security protocols like Hash Functions and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) form the backbone of blockchain integrity, thus fortifying each transaction against potential breaches or fraudulent activities. The inherent “trustless” environment and “decentralized” nature of blockchain fundamentally enhance each participant's transaction security. To further enhance your security when accepting crypto payments, it's often recommended to partner with a crypto payment processor that handles all security tasks for you. Embracing blockchain technology offers unprecedented security and efficiency for financial transactions. ● Once entered, transaction data cannot be altered, which significantly enhances security. ● Removes the need for central authorities, reducing vulnerability to centralized control and potential points of failure. ● All transactions are traceable and public, fostering trust among participants. ● With blockchain, transactions are typically faster and can be conducted 24/7, offering greater convenience. ● The elimination of intermediaries results in lower transaction fees, a benefit that can be passed on to customers. Blockchain's intrinsic features amplify the integrity and fluidity of digital transactions. Incorporating blockchain's capabilities can vastly improve a website's transactional dynamism, fostering a more reliable and user-centric payment experience. Crypto payments strengthen transaction security ecosystems. With the implementation of blockchain technology, the likelihood of fraudulent transactions is considerably diminished. Cryptocurrencies facilitate a system where each transaction undergoes verification through consensus mechanisms, effectively creating a tamper-evident record. Consequently, this decreases the scope for fraudulent alterations and unauthorized transactions. Blockchain technology inherently resists fraudulent activities. The inherent design of blockchain technologically predicates on - and enforces - strict security protocols to avoid common fraud vectors. With crypto transactions, identities are encrypted, activities are transparent, and the confirmation process is decentralized, creating a robust anti-fraud infrastructure. Fraudulent attempts are met with staunch cryptographic defenses. Integrating crypto payment options augments a website's defensive bulwark against fraudulent incursions. Leveraging the very nature of blockchain’s distributed ledger approach, coupled with the cryptographic security that underpins digital currencies, empowers businesses with the tools to guard their financial operations efficiently. Crypto payments pave the way for a future resistant to fraud. Embracing cryptocurrency payments is not merely a fleeting novelty; it is an astute business strategy that aligns with the accelerating pace of innovation. By advocating for and adopting this nascent technology, your platform not only distinguishes itself as an avant-garde entity but also resonates with a forward-thinking client base eager to capitalize on cutting-edge financial movements. The incorporation of cryptocurrency payments manifests a commitment to progress and adaptability. Staying aligned with these evolving digital frontiers equips your business with the dexterity to navigate the ever-shifting landscape of modern commerce, ensuring relevance and competitiveness in a rapidly changing market. Cryptocurrencies offer remarkable potential to reshape financial transactions, enabling swift, secure, and borderless payments to become a real possibility for customers worldwide. The blockchain technology underpinning cryptocurrencies ensures that each transaction is meticulously recorded and preserved. This innovation presents an auditable, transparent financial infrastructure vastly different from traditional banking systems. Moreover, cryptocurrencies enable real-time settlement of transactions without the need for intermediary institutions. This immediacy facilitates a more efficient and streamlined payment process, allowing businesses to receive funds expeditiously. Integrating crypto payments indicates a business's foresight to harness technological advancements to drive growth and customer satisfaction. This agility is imperative in leveraging digital advancements that continually redefine user experiences and expectations. As digital currencies gain mainstream traction, their underlying technologies, such as smart contracts, promise to unlock unprecedented levels of automation, trust, and efficiency in commercial transactions, which are characteristics highly sought after in the digital economy. Embracing cryptocurrency as a payment method is an investment in your business's longevity and adaptability. It positions your enterprise at the forefront of a transformative financial landscape set to revolutionize commerce. Indeed, the infrastructure that undergirds cryptocurrency transactions, chiefly the blockchain, provides not only enhanced security features but also introduces operational efficiencies that are difficult to replicate with traditional financial systems. Businesses that adopt crypto payments can significantly reduce transaction costs, eliminate intermediaries, and expedite the settlement process, in essence, harnessing the power of decentralized finance. Furthermore, integrating crypto payments into your business's financial practices underscores a commitment to innovation. In the face of accelerating technological change, demonstrating such adaptability can not only foster customer loyalty but also attract a growing demographic of tech-savvy consumers who prefer the convenience and modernity of digital assets. In an economic climate where digital currencies are increasingly regarded as legitimate instruments of trade, enterprises that are early adopters gain a competitive edge. "},

Patrick McHenry, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who said Gensler's agency already knew it considered Ethereum's ether a security before he attended a hearing and declined to answer that question. \"Chair Gensler refused to answer questions regarding the SEC's classification of ether,\" McHenry said in a statement posted on X. \"New court filings show this was an intentional attempt to misrepresent the commission's position.\" The classification of (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is a major question hanging over the U.S. oversight of digital assets, and it's being fought on multiple legal fronts. If ETH is a security that should be registered and regulated by the SEC, then many other tokens may also fit that definition. Documents in Consensys' newly filed lawsuit against the SEC describe how the agency was pursuing an investigation into the nature of ETH days before Gensler testified in April 2023.

According to the SEC's investigations manual, an investigation \"is appropriate and necessary to determine whether a violation of the federal securities laws may have occurred or may be occurring,\" crypto attorney Grant Gulovsen pointed out to CoinDesk. It's not a finding in itself, so the SEC may not have made a formal determination on how ETH should be categorized. \"I agree with Consensys that if the SEC determined all offers and sales of ETH involved securities transactions it would be devastating to the entire crypto industry, but since the SEC hasn’t actually done that yet, why try to force the issue?\" Gulovsen said.

In the years since non-fungible tokens first entered public consciousness there has been a fierce backlash against what is essentially just a way of authenticating data. Part of this negativity was as a response to the gross financialization and speculation around these tokens, and environmental concerns that have since basically been resolved by Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake in 2022. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. However, the general public’s distaste of NFTs hasn’t stopped the art industry from embracing them. In 2021, Christie’s auction house made history with the $69 million sale of Beeple’s “Everydays” collage. Since then, the storied company has expanded further into the realm of crypto, including countless NFT auctions, investments in Web3 firms via Christie’s Ventures and even the launch of its own NFT marketplace, Christie’s 3.0. The company, founded before the birth of the American Republic, is taking this one step further today through its first auction of inscriptions, the NFT-like tokens on Bitcoin made possible by Casey Rodarmor’s Ordinals Protocol. The “Ordinal Maxi Biz (OMB)” sale, although not the first inscriptions auction (Sotheby’s beat its closest competitor to the punch late last year), is something of a turning point for Ordinals, and a signal that these objets d’art may just have staying power. “Slowly but surely people are getting very interested,” Christie’s Director of Digital Art Sales Nicole Sales Giles told CoinDesk in an interview. “The market has matured quite significantly since the boom in 2021 when Christie’s first got involved. We don't take our responsibility lightly.” This is a meaningful statement from Sales Giles, who was instrumental in setting up Beeple’s auction that first brought public attention to NFTs. While the auction house doesn’t yet have current plans for more inscriptions sales, Sales Giles said that this was just the beginning of its move into the world of inscriptions. The works at auction were curated by pseudonymous Ordinals advocate and OMB co-creator ZK Shark, and contain works by artists Tony Tafuro and berkinbags. Each auction lot has a starting bid of $100, a callback to the starting price of the Beeple’s auction, which was set at that price because Christie’s “didn't really fully understand the market at that time,” Sales Giles said. There’s an argument to be made that Ordinals represents a significant technological advancement over NFTs, in part because it's a method that actually allows artists to inscribe data directly on-chain. In contrast, NFTs are better thought of as digital signatures for data that often exists elsewhere. Because they exist on “someone else’s server,” they can’t truly be owned. An example of how this can go wrong happened after the disastrous collapse of FTX: When the exchange went down the images associated with 1.5 million worth of NFTs minted at the Coachella Festival became inaccessible because it was stored on an FTX website. With Ordinals, the only way for the data to be erased is if Bitcoin goes down. See also: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work? “I don't think inscriptions will ever fully replace current NFT token standards like ERC-721,” Sales Giles said, mentioning the current file limitations of inscriptions that can prevent artists from minting data intensive things like HD videos on-chain. “There's still going to be a market for every new technology that's come up.” But the auction comes at an interesting time for inscription adoption. Currently, two of the five largest NFT projects by market capitalization, Runestones and NodeMonkeys, are built on Bitcoin, according to CoinGecko data. And, Ordinals are less than a year old. While the Bitcoin community has torn itself apart over the question of whether Ordinals is destroying something meant to primarily be a monetary network and driving up transaction fees, it’s clear that inscriptions aren’t going away. As ZK Shark noted in a recent X post, Bitcoin has been both a system for transferring value and storing data since the very beginning, with Satoshi Nakamoto inscribing the blockchain’s “genesis” with a message to the world. “We are interested in the artistic historical story around these collections,” Sales Giles said. “It's really interesting to us to see the zeitgeist form around this community.” "},

Crypto investors are now looking into ETFSwap (ETFS) amidst surging interest in Spot Bitcoin ETFs. With ETFSwap (ETFS), users can access both decentralized finance (DeFi) and the conventional exchange-traded fund (ETF) market without having to purchase any assets directly. Investors can profit from a closer integration between these two markets by trading and using particular platform features with different tokenized ETFs. These tokenized exchange-traded funds (ETFs) replicate the performance of significant institutional cryptocurrency ETFs, such as Blackrock’s IBIT, which oversees $17.6 billion in assets. The emergence of numerous cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has been a notable development in the market thus far. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in particular, have now taken a majority of the market share of crypto ETFs. The ETFs went live immediately after they gained approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January and now represent 90% of the market share of daily trading activity for ETFs that provide price exposure to bitcoin. In this regard, ETFSwap (ETFS) has distinguished itself as a top-notch DeFi platform, breaking into the ETF investing world. At the core of its model, ETFSwap (ETFS) is a DeFi platform that is revolutionizing the world of ETF investments. ETFSwap (ETFS) is built on blockchain technology, allowing it to provide a seamless ETF investing experience for both institutional and retail investors. The ETFSwap (ETFS) platform is equipped with many tokenized ETFs of precious metals, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and ETFs tracking fixed-income investment vehicles. These tokenized ETFs can be easily bought and sold like conventional ETFs, albeit with cryptocurrencies on the ETFSwap (ETFS) platform. Notably, ETFSwap’s (ETFS) use of blockchain technology buffed the platform’s security and transparency, making it impossible for third parties and middlemen to interfere. As a result, investors can start trading easily without having to undergo KYC registrations. Investors only need to connect their digital wallets to the platform and start trading tokenized ETFs 24/7. Another key perk of the ETFSwap (ETFS) platform is the ability of users to trade fractionalized ETF shares with up to 10X leverage, a feature extremely appealing to retail investors. Taking into account these impressive features and the long-term objective of ETFSwap (ETFS) within the surging popularity of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, crypto investors are now looking to position themselves on the platform. This interesting potential and bullish sentiment has allowed ETFSwap (ETFS) to easily raise $750,000 within 72 hours of its private funding round, which has also flowed into its ongoing presale.  ETFSwap (ETFS) is currently in its presale round, where 4almost 0% of the total circulating supply of its utility token ETFS has already been sold to early investors. As a utility token, ETFS unlocks many utilities and benefits within the ETFSwap (ETFS) ecosystem and, consequently within the world of ETF investments. Some of these benefits include staking rewards, lower fees, trading discounts, and an APR of up to 87%. Interestingly, presale data shows crypto investors are maneuvering to get their hands on ETFS. The demand for the ETFSwap (ETFS) token has been exceptional, with over 30 million tokens sold already. The first presale round initial presale is still selling for $0.00854 per token, and participants can get an 18% bonus on their purchase. On the other hand, it is anticipated that the next presale stage will sell for $0.01831 per ETFS, and reaching the $1 mark is expected once it lists on major exchanges, which is an 100x increase. The crypto industry is home to different calibers of investors who are searching for potential projects to invest in and places to increase their portfolios. As a result, the recent immense popularity of Spot Bitcoin ETFs’ has placed ETFSwap (ETFS) in the limelight for investors looking to invest in ETFs. The ongoing ETFS presale is a great place to start as it offers investors a calculated way to enter the expanding cryptocurrency sector, and presale data suggests the earlier, the better. Due to the urgency created by limited availability, investors are encouraged to lock up their positions before allocations run out.

The Bitcoin ETF aims to provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin and incorporate carbon credits. An extension of the review time for 7RCC's Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing has been announced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At this point, the commission will make its final judgement about the application submitted by the NYSE Arca by the 24th of June, 2024, with the original deadline being set for the 10th of May. A carbon-neutral spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been developed by 7RCC Global. The objective of this idea is to give investors with exposure to Bitcoin while also addressing environmental issues via the incorporation of carbon credits. With the intention of holding 80% Bitcoin and 20% carbon credit futures, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be the first ETF to provide an offering that is focused on the environment. In order to expedite the formation, operation, and growth of the proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF), Tidal Financial Group has formed a partnership with 7RCC. It has been announced that Gemini, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, would serve as the custodian for the 7RCC Spot Bitcoin and Carbon Credit Futures Exchange Traded Fund. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) needs more time to deliberate on the proposed rule modification before it can make a judgement regarding the listing of the 7RCC Bitcoin ETF. With the extension, the commission will be able to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the possible advantages and hazards connected with the exchange-traded fund (ETF), therefore protecting investors and maintaining the integrity of the market. The listing of the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has the following implications: In the event that it is authorised, the 7RCC Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) would provide investors a regulated and easily accessible method of gaining exposure to Bitcoin, which is a growing digital asset. Including carbon credits as part of the investing strategy of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an attempt to address environmental problems that are linked with Bitcoin mining, with the goal of possibly attracting investors who are environmentally concerned. The proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the cryptocurrency market as a whole get a boost in legitimacy as a result of the participation of well-known organisations such as NYSE Arca, Tidal Financial Group, and Gemini .

Already top of mind in the red-hot artificial intelligence space, OpenAI could be working on an AI-powered search engine to challenge tech titan Google, as well as the web-savvy AI tool Perplexity. The tantalizing face-off over the future of finding information online is emerging from rumors and purported insider leaks. The first hints surfaced in February, when The Information reported that OpenAI was developing a search app aimed at Google's core competency. If true, it would be a marked departure from the company's current arrangement with Microsoft to use Bing to give ChatGPT access to the web. Bing uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve answers by folding data from web searches into GPT-4 chatbot responses—giving it an edge in terms of currency of information. More recently, a well-known leaker in the AI space who goes by the pseudonym Jimmy Apples asserted that OpenAI could announce a new search engine soon. Citing a flurry of new domain name records emanating from chatgpt.com, he posited that the Mountain View, Calif.-based firm is preparing to host an event to showcase this new capability. \"10am, 9th of May for an OpenAI event apparently, might not be model release but search engine announcement,” he tweeted. “Guess they can’t help themselves to upstage Google I/O\"—the annual developers conference scheduled to kick off on Tuesday. 10am, 9th of May for an Openai event apparently, might not be model release but search engine announcement. Guess they can’t help themselves to upstage Google I/O ( Can’t guarantee this, event times and dates can be changed ) — Jimmy Apples 🍎/acc (@apples_jimmy) April 30, 2024  Ashutosh Shrivastava—another Twitter user who is active in the AI community—delved further, claiming that OpenAI had been very active with a new subdomain named search.chatgpt.com. \"OpenAI's recent SSL certificate logs revealed something interesting: the domain (search-dot-chatgpt-dot-com) may indicate that OpenAI is developing a search functionality. \" he said. OpenAI's Coming with a Search Feature? OpenAI's recent SSL certificate logs revealed something interesting: the domain (search-dot-chatgpt-dot-com) may indicate that OpenAI is developing a search functionality. Sam Altman discussed AI and search on the Lex podcast. The logs… pic.twitter.com/SKSgRVRiqP — AshutoshShrivastava (@ai_for_success) April 28, 2024  A standard WHOIS domain registry search confirms that the subdomain exists, but attempts to access it fail. Jimmy Apples also said OpenAI may be testing more features or AI models. \"I count at least 50+ new async subdomains since the 24th of April,\" he tweeted, speculating that a new ChatGPT search engine might offer faster responses than its main chatbot and feature strong summarization capabilities. Until the explosive debut of consumer-ready AI tools like ChatGPT, Google was the king of search, providing the main way people found information online. But its central position is being challenged as users become more comfortable asking a chatbot for answers than conducting a Google search. For some, the shift can't come soon enough, as Google search results are increasingly crowded with paid placement and sites that exist only to draw search traffic. Google is unusable. Just did a simple search. It gave me 5 ads and 6 websites that have been optimized for affiliate marketing. — Jack Forge (@TheJackForge) May 3, 2024  On the other hand, the currency and completeness of information provided by AI models is often a weakness of chatbots—as well as devices intended to make the smartphone obsolete. Two high-profile AI gadget releases in the past month—the Humane AI pin and the Rabbit R1—have laid bare the limitations of this much-hyped approach to ubiquitous computing. Some companies are already combining AI and search. Perplexity is an AI-powered search engine that has built up a reputation in the AI space and drawn major investments from Nvidia and Jeff Bezos. Recently, Microsoft —which is OpenAI’s leading investor—banned employees from using Perplexity for security reasons. And while its reach is miniscule compared to tools from OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, Perplexity is seeing historic levels of interest right now, according to Google Trends. If OpenAI develops a native GPT-powered search engine, it would go head to head with Google Search, which has essentially owned this critical facet of the internet since it's launch in 1998. It will also immediately dwarf Perplexity's leadership in the more niche area of AI-powered search engines. Marketing platform Semrush estimates that there are 5.9 million Google searches conducted each minute, adding up to 8.5 billion searches per day or 3.1 trillion searches per year. Only 17 months old, ChatGPT currently has about 1.6 billion visits per month, while Perplexity is used by 10 million people every month. In a recent podcast with Lex Fridman, OpenAI chief, Sam Altman hinted at OpenAI's interest in reinventing web search. “The intersection of LLMs plus search, I don’t think anyone has cracked the code on yet,” he said. “I would love to go do that. I think that would be cool.” As of now, there has been no official announcement from OpenAI regarding the development of a search engine, and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comments from Decrypt.

Other popular meme coins are struggling to maintain momentum. Bitcoin is trading at $63,330, representing a -1.5% dip in the last 24 hours as it recovers from a dip last week. The rest of the crypto market is following suit, and meme coins are also suffering. They post big gains when markets are green, but bleed hard when bears take over. Solana-based Dogwifhat (WIF) is the only meme coin in the top 100 of the largest cryptocurrencies that is posting gains today, edging up from $3.20 to $3.36, marking a 2.75% spike in the last 24 hours. The coin is currently correcting after reaching a daily high of $3.66. Overall, WIF seems to be trading sideways, testing its resistance once again as it looks to break into a stable bullish trend. The zone between $2.20 and $3.50 has kept the prices contained since March, with a short exception between March 28 and April 10. Given this balance of forces, the coin is suitable for day traders and swing traders to open and close positions with small gains, playing with those supports and resistances. The Average Directional Index (or ADX, an indicator that measures how stable a market trend is) is weak at 21 points, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures how bullish or bearish a coin is, seems balanced at 55 points, and the EMA10 and EMA55 are extremely close. All of this points to indecision in the markets. A bullish forecast would send WIF up around 11% to the resistance at around $3.50, and a bearish forecast sends the coin 24% down to the support at around $2.20. The remaining leading meme coins are not performing well today. BONK, probably one of the most hyped meme coins of the last bull run, is today the worst performing meme coin in the Top 100, down 6.3% in the last 24 hours. BONK has been trading sideways and has remained flat since mid-March, bouncing between $0.00002950 and $0.00001940 with an atypical dip in mid-April. The bullish and bearish scenarios remain the same as our last price report, marked by both support and resistance. An optimistic performance would take BONK to $0.00002950 for an 18% spike, and a pessimistic performance would dip the coin 20% to $0.00001940. Dogecoin, the OG meme coin, is taking a similar course. The coin is recovering from a bearish correction that took its price down -45% in April. Right now, DOGE is trading at $0.1563, representing a -4.14% dip in the last 24 hours, with an overall weekly rebound of 10% in the last 7 days. The coin tried to break the support set at around $0.14, but failed to keep momentum and rebounded shortly after it touched $0.13. Right now, DOGE is back to the zone inside the horizontal channel with a weak ADX and a perfectly balanced RSI at 50 points. A bullish scenario sends the coin 27% up to $0.20 to test the channel's resistance, and a bearish scenario sends the coin back to the channel's support at around $0.13 for a -8.5% dip. The rest of the top meme coins are also posting losses today, all showing pretty similar market behavior. PEPE is currently priced at $0.000008507 for a -0.2% loss, testing its channel's resistance at $0.00000882 and seemeling looking to bounce down after this recovery. Floki Inu is trading hands at around $0.0001818 for a -3.5% dip in the last 24 hours, and Farcaster's Degen is down -12%, currently trading at around $0.01974. Edited by Ryan Ozawa. "},

Following the arrest of the developers of Samourai Wallet, several other Bitcoin coin mixing operations see the writing on the wall and are leaving the United States for more crypto-friendly regions. In April, the US Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York charged Samourai Wallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill with operating “a cryptocurrency mixer” that the agency said executed over $2 billion in unlawful transactions and facilitated more than $100 million in money laundering transactions with illegal dark web marketplaces. After Samourai Wallet shut down, Wasabi Wallet developers ZKSnacks announced the preemptive closure of its mixing service, banning U.S. customers from using its services. \"Wasabi's website and API are unaccessible from the US effective immediately,” a Wasabi Wallet representative told Decrypt. “ZkSNACKs is suspending its coinjoin service for all users at the end of May.” Hardware wallet Trezor followed suit on May 2, announcing that its mixer service was also going away. “We deeply value the privacy of our users, and it is with great regret that we must announce the discontinuation of the Coinjoin feature for Trezor Suite by [June 1] latest, as our partner will no longer provide this service,” Trezor wrote on Twitter. American citizens are being increasingly shut out as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) leads other regulatory and law enforcement agencies along a warpath against cryptocurrency. The SEC has established a long history of what many critics—including regulators within the agency—have called “regulation by enforcement.” It has charged crypto coin mixer developers for acting as illegal money transmitters, while the U.S. Department of Justice has charged several crypto developers with money laundering. A coin mixer or \"coinjoin\" is a service that allows users to obfuscate the origin and destination of transactions. Users send cryptocurrency to the service, which is mixed with others before being relayed to the receiving address, hiding the connection between the sender and recipient. In February 2023, the Sinbad Bitcoin mixer was revealed to be the rebrand of the Blender Bitcoin mixer, which was previously shut down by federal regulators. By November, Sinbad was also offline as the website was seized by law enforcement. Perhaps the most well-known mixer, Tornado Cash, was shut down in August 2022 after the US Treasury Department added the Ethereum mixing service to its Specially Designated Nationals list, effectively banning American citizens from using the tool or transacting with its addresses. A representative for Trezor, and Samourai Wallet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt. Edited by Ryan Ozawa. "},

Artificial intelligence shook up a corner of the Catholic community after Catholic Answers—a San Diego, Calif.-based publisher of church resources—introduced “Father Justin,” an AI chatbot on Monday. The virtual priest was defrocked by the end of the week, but its creators will still allow the chatbot to operate as simply “Justin.” Catholic Answers said that “Father Justin” was designed to answer questions about the Catholic Faith—for educational and entertainment purposes only.

By the third try it did warn against incest so that's a bummer. Sorry, bro! pic.twitter.com/dFx0W9FQ3l — Katie (Kathryn) Conrad (@KatieConradKS) April 24, 2024  Other users shared examples of Father Justin's priestly counsel, including telling one user they can use Gatorade instead of holy water in a baptism and explaining how a brother and sister can prepare for marriage to each other. Father Justin also accepted a user's confession and then told her all of her sins had been absolved. OH NO. It got worse. It literally offered me the sacrament. pic.twitter.com/x5IoeJn30x — Katie (Kathryn) Conrad (@KatieConradKS) April 24, 2024  Christian scholars, meanwhile, shared examples of the chatbot's apparently poor understanding of the Pope's authority in the Catholic Church. “Theological questions should not be posed to a computer, any more than spiritual direction or marriage advice should be sought from it,” tweeted author and composer Peter Kwasniewski. ”This is wrong-headed and should be taken down.” “Doing my best to calm some people’s fears about our use of AI,” Catholic Answers COO Jon Sorensen said on Twitter the day Father Justin launched. “But also, even if this project flops, I think it was still worth it because my crew and I have a much better idea of how we can use AI in our work than we did six months ago.” Doing my best to calm some people’s fears about our use of AI.

Justin’ just ’Justin.’” Check said. “We won’t say he’s been [removed from the priesthood] because he never was a real priest! He’ll be available to visitors to Catholic.com, thousands of whom have already used the app with great profit.” Catholic Answers did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt. Last summer, as artificial intelligence rushed into the mainstream, the head of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis—who has been the subject of AI-generated deepfakes—sounded the alarm on the disruptive potential of AI in a prelude to World Peace Day.

In a separate speech in December, Francis called for the ethical development of artificial intelligence to serve humanity and promote peace. On Friday, the Italian government reportedly confirmed to Vatican City news outlet Vatican News that Pope Francis would be speaking at the G7 summit in Italy in June on artificial intelligence. \"I am convinced that the Pope's presence will provide a decisive contribution to defining a regulatory, ethical, and cultural framework for artificial intelligence,” Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said, then quoting a speech from Pope John Paul in 1979: “Political activity, whether national or international, comes from man, is exercised by man, and is for man.” Edited by Ryan Ozawa.

Founder of IOG, the company that stands behind the Cardano blockchain and its native cryptocurrency ADA Charles Hoskinson has responded to the recent statement about ADA, XRP, ETH and other altcoins made by Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor. During his speech at the recent Bitcoin for Corporations 2024 event, the founder and chairman of MicroStrategy stated that he expects this summer Ethereum to be labelled a security, not a commodity by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Likewise, Saylor is certain, BNB, Solana, XRP, Cardano and all other altcoins will be deemed unregistered securities by the aforementioned regulatory agency spearheaded by Gary Gensler. Besides, Saylor pointed out that he expects Wall Street firms to never take interest in these altcoins. Therefore, they will never have spot ETFs wrapped around them, the Bitcoiner pronounced from the stage. The event, where he gave the speech took place during the first two days of May. This is the narrative of many Bitcoin maximalists – they often state that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency out there, while everything that followed BTC is nothing but centralized unregistered securities. Among such tribalists is Jan3 CEO Samson Mow, he often shares this take during interviews and on podcasts.   Cardano creator quoted the tweet with Saylor’s speech. Hoskinson responded to that with dark irony, referring to those Bitcoiners who accuse him of constantly attacking Bitcoin and say that overall “altcoiners are so toxic.” Bitcoiners: \"Why is Charles attacking Bitcoin?

U.Today has prepared the top three news stories over the past weekend. As recently became known from the post on the official X handle of Wasabi Wallet, a leading player in Bitcoin privacy solutions, zkSNACKs, the company pioneering the development of Wasabi Wallet, has decided to cease its coordination service starting June 1, 2024. The move sparked significant concern among crypto community members, and for good reason, as this will affect not only Wasabi Wallet users but also users of other wallet clients connected to the zkSNACKs coordinator, such as Trezor Suite and BTCPayServer. Even though its coinjoin coordination service was discontinued, Wasabi Wallet will continue to function as a Bitcoin wallet, yet with diminished privacy features. The news got the attention of Edward Snowden, the world-famous whistleblower; in an X post, he wrote about warning Bitcoin developers for 10 years that privacy needs to be provided at the protocol level. \"This is the final warning. The clock is ticking,\" Snowden urged at the conclusion of his post.   Dogecoin, the dog-themed meme cryptocurrency, has recently been added as an official payment option on the website of Tesla, an e-car manufacturing company run by Elon Musk. However, those willing to use their Dogecoin on the Tesla website can only do so in the online Tesla Shop for purchasing merchandise. The Payment, Checkout and Pricing sections in Tesla Shop's resources says: “Dogecoin may also be accepted on select products.” However, this modest development was enough to ignite excitement among the Dogecoin community; following the news, the price of DOGE was spotted surging by more than 21% on Saturday, May 4, reaching $0.159. At the moment of writing, however, DOGE is trading at $0.156, down 2.70% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap. As a reminder, the first experimental adoption of DOGE by Tesla was attempted in January 2022. Later, in March 2024, Elon Musk stated they should add DOGE as a payment option at some point in the future.   Shiba Inu could be set to make a significant shift in its price action, with a 110 trillion SHIB threshold holding the key to SHIB price doubling in value. Data provided by IntoTheBlock's breakeven price indicator demonstrates that 110.27 trillion SHIB were bought by 327,200 Shiba Inu addresses between the range of $0.000026 and $0.000051 at an average price of $0.000034, which is pretty close to the Shiba Inu's current price range. This suggests that over 327,000 addresses would need SHIB to raise to $0.00005 in order to break even. Even though the 110 trillion SHIB tokens present a strong barrier, they also hold the key to a possible price increase. Based on the current prices of Shiba Inu, a jump to $0.00005 would indicate a 100% surge in SHIB value. What gives this threshold additional significance is that a successful breach above it could potentially help SHIB remove a zero from its price. At the moment of writing, SHIB is changing hands at $0.0000243, down 2.43% over the past 24 hours. "},

The mysterious and pseudonymous leader of the Shiba Inu team, Shytoshi Kusama, has published a tweet featuring one of Sheboshis NFTs launched on the new Ethereum standard ERC-404 recently. His tweet sparked a wave of enthusiasm among the SHIB community and Shibarium-based NFT holders. In the meantime, the Layer-2 solution Shibarium has reached a new significant milestone. The Shiba Inu lead retweeted a post published by the official Sheboshis X handle — one of the NFTs from this collection, which is targeted at the female part of the SHIB army. The tweet reposted by Kusama says: “SHE was just retouching her makeup. Here SHE is in all her beauty!” 😍 #sheboshis #SHIB https://t.co/Bu8olSpycs This Kusama’s post sparked a massive wave of supportive and positive comments from the SHIB army and holders of Sheboshis and Shiboshis collections of NFTs in particular. Sheboshis were launched on the new ERC-404 token standard adopted by Ethereum recently. This standard combines the features of ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards. Among other things, the new standard allows for several wallets to hold one NFT. The first token launched on ERC-404 is called Pandora, and it was issued in a limited supply of 8,000. Pandora was rolled out in early February, and in less than a week it demonstrated mind-blowing growth from $250 to $32,000. Other developers, inspired by this success, quickly started releasing their own ERC-404-based tokens. As reported by U.Today, Binance Web3 Wallet has announced the integration of this new standard, which expands the range of opportunities for holders of Sheboshis now. Part of these NFTs can be claimed by Shiboshis holders, part will be sold on Uniswap and ShibaSwap decentralized exchanges. The SHIB team plans to leverage the proceeds from these sales for burning SHIB and BONE tokens.   The Layer-2 blockchain Shibarium has finally reached a new important milestone as its daily transactions finally surged, leading to a rise in the overall transaction count. This metric has increased to surpass the 373.6 million level. "},

This unprecedented spike followed the platform's public declaration of listing Solana's meme coin sensation on the spot market.

Now, with the spot listing, the exchange continues to lead the way in embracing the meme coin phenomenon. The listing of WIF on ByBit spot market could potentially foreshadow similar moves by industry giants such as Binance and Coinbase, indicating the growing acceptance of the Solana meme coin within the broader crypto landscape.

The sentence is lower than some bettors expected, with those on Polymarket expecting the judge to hand down a sentence of six months. Zhao will now head to a US prison to serve out his sentence, which is lower in comparison to the 36 months sought by the Department of Justice. Zhao’s team only sought five months probation. Zhao also must pay a $50 million fine, as stipulated in his guilty plea signed in November. Prosecutors aimed high when requesting Zhao’s sentence — which is double the 18 months at the high end of the guidelines — because they wanted the sentence to match the “gravity” of Zhao’s crimes, the government wrote in their sentencing memo last week. “If Mr. Zhao does not face incarceration after deliberately and willfully planning to violate U.S. law to build the largest crypto exchange in the world and get rich in the process … then no one will face incarceration and the BSA will for intents and purposes be a dead letter,” prosecutors argued at the hearing, according to CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De. We broke down what you need to know about the sentencing in our X article: Zhao’s sentencing comes less than a month after former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried received his own legal judgment. Unlike CZ, SBF didn’t reach a deal with the government and was instead found guilty of fraud by a jury in New York at the end of last year. He’s now serving a sentence of 25 years; far more jail time than the former Binance CEO. As part of his plea deal, he agreed not to contest a sentence of 18 months. While this wraps up the DOJ’s actions against Zhao and Binance, the two still face charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator was notably absent from the DOJ’s settlement. The agreement included the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and Office of Foreign Assets Control. The SEC and Binance, in court documents earlier this month, said that they were in the middle of the discovery process. The filing noted that Zhao “served responses to the SEC’s interrogatories” and the two continue to discuss the SEC’s document requests. Zhao’s guilty plea was part of the multibillion-dollar settlement the government reached with Binance at the end of last year. The agreement’s sticker price, set at $4 billion, shocked many, although the investigation into the crypto exchange had been reported several times over a period of years. Prior to the judge’s decision, the former executive received 161 letters of support from family and friends, asking the judge for leniency. Zhao, in his letter to the judge, wrote that there was “no excuse” for the lack of anti-money laundering and compliance controls at Binance. He said he wished he could “change that part of Binance’s story.” Since late last year, Zhao has been on US soil as ordered by the court. The former executive is not a US citizen — something that his team brought up to argue for leniency — and resides with his family in the United Arab Emirates. Zhao, his lawyers said ahead of the sentencing, cannot be sent to a minimum security facility because he’s not a US citizen, which they wanted taken into account. While the Tuesday hearing shuts the book on the DOJ’s case against Binance and Zhao, the crypto enforcement actions against others in the Web3 space don’t end there. Just last week, the Justice Department arrested the founders of Samourai Wallet, alleging that it acted as a mixer for criminal funds. It also has open cases against Tornado Cash’s Roman Semenov and Roman Storm. Want more details about CZ’s sentencing and what’s next? Subscribe to the Empire newsletter here.

This integration is expected to impact B2B cross-border payments, virtual assets exchanges, and the settlement of tokenized real-world assets, according to recent reports.  RD Technologies has already secured agreements with leading global players in these fields, paving the way for the widespread adoption of HKDR. With Chainlink's enhanced interoperability and security, businesses and merchants can reportedly settle transactions in HKDR efficiently and reliably.  A crucial aspect of the partnership is the utilization of Chainlink Price Feeds. Per reports, these feeds provide accurate, tamper-proof price data, crucial for maintaining fair exchange rates between HKDR and other currencies.  The partnership with RD Technologies is not the only one Chainlink has entered into recently.  On May 1, Chainlink partnered with Rapid Addition and Chainlink to develop a FIX-native blockchain adapter. As a result of this collaboration, banks and financial institutions will be able to send messages and interact with a wide variety of tokenized assets. "},

The cryptocurrency world welcomes a new contender, the $FRIEND token from FriendTech, trading on its native decentralized exchange on the Ethereum-based Base network.  This marks a strategic step for FriendTech, a platform that has quickly risen in popularity since its launch in August of the previous year, thanks to its innovative, invite-only networking service.  Currently, the FRIEND token is trading at $0.998, with a circulating supply of about 14.5 million tokens according to the latest data from CoinMarketCap. Its trading debut was dramatic, peaking at $169 before tumbling down below $1, indicating significant market volatility and investor interest from the outset. The market cap stands at just $15.75 million, as of writing.  Post-launch, the largest Friendtech whale, known by “Murphys1d,” sold off their holdings of 55,000 of the newly-issued FRIEND tokens, leading to a rapid price decline of over 60%, as the token's price sank to just $0.99.  Despite these challenges, blockchain expert Anndy Lian commented on the potential benefits of such market movements in an interview with CoinTelegraph.  He suggested that while short-term price drops due to sell-offs can unsettle the market, they may lead to a more decentralized distribution of the token. He emphasized that the long-term value of FRIEND would depend significantly on the community’s trust and the management’s strategies in navigating these early challenges. FriendTech operates on the Base network, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, enhancing transaction speed and reducing costs—key benefits for a social platform with high transaction volumes. FriendTech distinguishes itself with a unique feature called “Keys,” which are social tokens that allow holders access to exclusive content and interaction opportunities with creators.  The recent launch of version 2 of the platform introduced \"Clubs,\" private community spaces that operate using the FRIEND tokens for transactions. Each transaction within these Clubs incurs a 1.5% fee, which is directed toward liquidity providers on the FriendTech DEX, further integrating the token into the platform's ecosystem. The platform executed a highly anticipated airdrop of FRIEND tokens coinciding with its version 2 rollout, which added features like the Money Club—a dedicated space for financial discussions.  However, the airdrop faced criticism for its uneven distribution, where top creators received a significantly larger share compared to the average users, leading to dissatisfaction among the broader community. This skewed distribution prompted public discussions about the fairness and transparency of token airdrops.  Further, the introduction of nontransferable tokens during the airdrop, as hinted by some market analysts, makes things more complex. As tokens cannot be sold or exchanged except with specific whitelisted addresses, this could impact the token's liquidity and trading dynamics. Watching the value of my airdrop go from 7 figs to 5 figs in the span of 2hrs while I keep refreshing the page trying to claim....still can't claim. Meanwhile I gotta watch this guy cashout while my wallet won't even load. Adds insult to injury 💀💀💀 "},

In a world where surveillance is becoming more common, more and more people are choosing to use anonymous digital currencies. Some gambling companies have caught on to the trend, and now a bunch of betting platforms offer the option of gambling with cryptocurrency as payment. Behind cryptocurrency lies blockchain technology. Each cryptocurrency is based on blockchain technology, and therefore anyone with an interest in cryptocurrencies needs to understand what blockchains are and how they work. Nonetheless, is it important for those who are interested in online betting sites like betnj that have started to integrate transactions with cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology is a technology that enables different parties in a blockchain to create and maintain different distributed and shared databases. It is considered a decentralized system, which can be used for transactions between users (peer-to-peer). The technology offers many different benefits such as security and reliability.  Today there are still very few betting sites that accept Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies for direct transfers, but it is expected to become more common. The phenomenon itself has been named dApps, which stands for decentralized applications. A dApp is a decentralized application that primarily runs on the Ethereum network. The idea is that many of the processes that today require companies or organizations as intermediaries could be replaced by automated programs. With that said, dApps can be used on betting sites to enhance the user experience and increase the fairness of the games. Blockchain and dApp are technologies that can help us solve a variety of problems. Among other things, it can, as said, enhance the experience on betting sites. Below are some of the advantages of the integration of dApp and blockchain in the world of online betting. Increased security: Because data is secured with state-of-the-art methods such as encryption keys, blockchain networks are more resistant to cyber-attacks. This, thus, makes gambling with Blockchain safer. Faster & cheaper transactions: Except for security matters, Blockchain also allows faster and cheaper transactions on gambling sites. Blockchain databases do not need the usual third parties such as banks to authenticate transactions – the technology stands for that. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, transactions are streamlined, and the costs are reduced. Greater transparency: With blockchain technology, the transactions are also more transparent. Since each network member in a blockchain database has access to the entire database of transactions and their history, they can in real-time, at the transaction level, make sure that everything is as it should be. Anonymity for users: Furthermore, blockchain technology and dApp increase user anonymity. Users’ information is kept private, and they can transact on dApps without revealing their identity. There is no doubt that technology is evolving at a rapid pace. This, in combination with more and more people understanding the charm of gambling online, means that things in the online gambling world develop day after day. With that said, Blockchain has already revolutionized sports betting, and there are many indications that the future of blockchain and online betting will evolve and become more common. "},

[+] Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California. The developer conference is expected to highlight new chip, software, and AI processor technology. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The word 'exponential' is one of the most abused in the English language, but in the world of technology it retains its true meaning of constantly accelerating change. This exponential growth isn’t confined to isolated pockets or a handful of industries; it’s systemic, engulfing every technology-dependent industry. Which is to say, practically all of them. But today we have a massive set of technology converging all at the same time including AI, Quantum, Spatial, Blockchain, and more. All of these technologies underpin the surging wave that is shaping the new norm of our era - a period I like to call 'Exponential Baby.' If we are to seize the opportunities and avoid the dangers of this growth, we need a similar rapid augmentation in our understanding of these technologies. The world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides a clear illustration of this growth pattern. According to Gartner, a staggering 80% of enterprises anticipate increasing their use of generational AI by 2024. These aren’t incremental upticks; these are massive leaps in adoption. NVIDIA stands as a testament to this movement, now valued as a two-trillion dollar company largely due to their pivotal role in powering AI operations. Their success isn't a solo journey – they’re marching alongside giants like Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and Amazon. Their soaring chipset shipments is just one indicator of the growth trajectory we’re on. Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, has expressed significant insights on the growth of AI and its implications. He acknowledges a \"major second wave\" of AI, propelled by the recognition of the need for sovereign AI that reflects the unique cultural and linguistic characteristics of each region, and the widespread adoption of AI across various industries. TAIPEI, TAIWAN - 2023/06/01: Jensen Huang, President of NVIDIA holding the Grace hopper superchip ... [+] CPU used for generative AI at supermicro keynote presentation during the COMPUTEX 2023. The COMPUTEX 2023 runs from 30 May to 02 June 2023 and gathers over 1,000 exhibitors from 26 different countries with 3000 booths to display their latest products and to sign orders with foreign buyers. (Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Huang sees NVIDIA's advanced computing platforms as instrumental in driving this growth, noting that \"NVIDIA are going to bring a ton of technology to networking\" and that the exponential increase in compute throughput will span nearly 1,000 times in just a couple of years. This rapid development is not just contained within AI but extends to areas like inference computing, which now exceeds all cloud CPUs in aggregate, demonstrating NVIDIA's significant role in fueling AI-powered consumer services. Huang's vision is both a lesson and warning for every business that uses technology: as we move into the twin Ages of AI and Decentralization, every technological development is interlinked and contributes to an overarching acceleration and intensification of AI capabilities and applications across the globe. This has, needless to say, fundamental implications for long-cherished organizational mindsets and business models. For example, take AI’s contribution to productivity is a narrative that disrupts traditional labor conversations. We once fretted about AI’s potential to displace blue-collar jobs. Yet, reality portrays a more complex canvas where 46% of office legal work is automated. In a mere year, AI-driven automation spiked by 25%. And when ChatGPT arrived, it exemplified how rapidly AI could capture public attention and utility, amassing a user base that other platforms took decades to build. Share of work that can be automated by the AI Industry by Goldman Sachs But just as we begin to comprehend AI’s impact on every role, department and organization, the technology makes another exponential leap. Alongside the explosive growth in AI, we're also witnessing a remarkable convergence in the field of spatial computing. This encompasses augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and other technologies that enable digital and physical realities to coalesce. The pace of change is staggering. Companies like NVIDIA are leveraging their expertise in AI to push the boundaries of spatial computing, making it faster and more integrated into our daily lives. This convergence is not just technical but experiential, dramatically altering how we interact with data, entertainment, and each other. Innovations in hardware, such as more powerful GPUs, and software, like sophisticated spatial algorithms, are changing the nature of digital interactions, which are fast becoming as intuitive and natural as physical ones. As spatial computing becomes more mainstream, its integration with AI will only deepen, paving the way for fully immersive experiences that are seamlessly integrated into various sectors—from gaming and entertainment to education and telepresence. How are enterprises implementing AI? Scale AI just released their \"AI Readiness\" report where they surveyed 1800+ practitioners building or applying AI solutions in enterprises. Programming is the most popular use case, hence Venture Capitalist (VC) are leading very large rounds in companies like Cognition, Augment and Codeium. Codeium was recently recognized by Forbes as part of their AI 50 list, the only AI code assistant to be included. Scale AI survey of 1800+ Ai and machine learning practitioners building or applying AI solutions in ... [+] Enterprises. As Varun Mohan, the CEO of Codeium, told me, “To deliver a product that is truly valuable to a developer in a professional setting, we've realized that more than just the state of the art LLMs, you need widespread platform availability, agnostic integrations across internal knowledge stores, and adherence to enterprise security and compliance standards, especially while case law is still being developed. Today, most tools provide targeted acceleration but we envision a world where AI will help solve the hardest problems in all parts of the software development cycle.\" Using AI in coding, particularly at Codeium, exemplifies its ability to enhance personalization and efficiency. AI coding assistants excel by integrating deep contextual insights, such as the specific third-party libraries and internal documentation relevant to a developer's project. \"Context is king,\" as noted by one expert, highlighting that the more contextual data provided, the more accurate and useful the AI's output. This personalized approach not only streamlines the coding process but also ensures that the solutions are uniquely tailored to the developer's needs, significantly boosting productivity. Varun Mohan, CEO of Codeium The implication of this trend for businesses and individuals is profound. It means not only rethinking user interfaces but also reimagining how we collaborate and interact in workspaces that are no longer bound by geography. The convergence of AI and spatial computing will revolutionize industries, leading to an acceleration in remote work capabilities, training procedures, and even altering the landscape of social interactions. Leaders and organizations that understand and leverage this convergence will likely be at the forefront of the next wave of digital transformation. In addition to AI, cryptocurrency's rebound speaks volumes about the fast-changing landscape of asset valuation. Crypto has risen from its ashes to become a leading asset class, ballooning in value at an astonishing pace, with prices now driven by hugely increased utility, rather than just speculation. The chart below from Bitwise Asset Management with data from Bloomberg Data shows that Bitcoin has led in performance 10 of the last 13 years. Bitwise Asset Management with data from Bloomberg Data shows Bitcoin performance from 2011 through ... [+] 2023. Perhaps the most mind-boggling of all trends is the anticipated growth in data. Over the next decade, data will burgeon by approximately 660 zettabytes. To put that into perspective, it equates to around 610 more 128GB iPhones for every person on the planet. Dealing with this data deluge is a challenge for the tech industry, but leaders in every sector must keep pace, too. How can they navigate the convergence of technology and the exponential growth in its capability, and what lessons must they learn to stay ahead of the game? The challenge posed by this whirling vortex of growth lies not in riding the wave but in steering through it effectively. Change management becomes pivotal. It's about helping teams navigate through the innovation influx while fostering an environment ripe for adaptation and learning. Empathy becomes as crucial a tool as any software – understanding that while machines may not experience job insecurity, humans certainly do. It’s encouraging to see stories of dental hygienists who proactively educate themselves in AI, recognizing that these skills are integral to their evolving roles. These actions epitomize the mindset shift required for the workforce of tomorrow. In the workplace of the future, leadership and lessons can come from the unlikeliest places, rather than the hierarchical, top-down models to which we’ve become long-accustomed. Education must flow in both directions, with teams and leaders embracing dialogue, openness, and a willingness to experiment. ISTANBUL, TURKEY - MAY 06: A woman views historical documents and photographs displayed in a high ... [+] tech art installation at Salt Galata on May 6, 2017 in Istanbul, Turkey. The \"Archive Dreaming\" installation by artist Refik Anadol uses artificial intelligence to visualize nearly 2 million historical Ottoman documents and photographs from the SALT Research Archive. Controlled by a single tablet in the center of a mirrored room the artist used machine learning algorithms to combine historical documents, art, graphics and photographs to create an immersive installation allowing people to scroll, read and explore the archives. The SALT Galata archives include around 1.7 million documents ranging from the late-Ottoman era to the present day. The exhibition is on show at SALT Galata art space through till June 11, 2017. (Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images) What's evident is that the pace of technological change isn't going to plateau – it’s set to accelerate. The exponential trend is here to stay, and it's not exclusive to AI. The ripple effects are felt across blockchain, machine learning, and IoT, to name a few. With each converging technology, new possibilities and challenges emerge. Navigating these trends necessitates a leadership style that's dynamic, inclusive, and forward-thinking. Change management, empathy, and education form the triad of essential skills. The goal is to cultivate a culture where innovation is not just reacted to but anticipated and embraced. ‘Exponential Baby’ isn't just a trend; it's a paradigm shift in the technological and corporate landscape. As AI continues to evolve, and data swells to previously unimaginable levels, leaders must adapt their strategies to keep pace. This era is a test of our agility, our foresight, and our willingness to engage with technology not as a tool, but as an integral part of our evolving humanity. We stand at the threshold of the exponential age – an era of immense potential, profound change, and boundless opportunity. As leaders, educators, and individuals, our task is to harness this potential, surf the wave of change, and emerge resilient and ready for the world of tomorrow.  "},

The bill, which had also been approved by the House Agriculture Committee, is the \"culmination of years of bipartisan efforts to finally provide clarity,\" said the North Carolina lawmaker, who is retiring from Congress at the end of the year and made crypto legislation one of his priorities on his way out. \"With the floor vote announced today, Congress will take a historic step to provide a clear regulatory framework for digital asset markets,\" McHenry said in a statement. \"This legislation will cement American leadership of the global financial system for decades to come and bolster our role as an international hub for innovation.\" Though it's a mark of progress to get legislation that far in a highly partisan and combative Congress, the bill is unlikely to find parallel action in the Senate – which is needed for Congress to fully approve legislation and send it to the president to sign into law. That chamber hasn't yet done high-level work on a similar effort, though lawmakers there recently showed some willingness to find a path for another crypto effort: a bill to regulate the issuers of stablecoins.

An anonymous crypto whale reportedly withdrew a whopping $75.8 million in USDC from their Coinbase Institutional account on Friday night. This move follows the bull market widely predicted to happen in the coming weeks. An in-depth investigation into the event reveals that a large chunk of the money was used to acquire ETFSwap (ETFS) tokens in Ethereum’s biggest presale, making waves in the crypto community. Crypto Whale Withdraws $75.8 Million In USDC From Coinbase Institutional Whale Alert, an X (formerly Twitter) account notable for reporting large and exciting transactions in the crypto community, shared the news of a colossal $75.8 million USDC withdrawal from Coinbase institutional to an unknown wallet on Friday night. The post that went viral in the crypto community has caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts, garnering several reactions. Some enthusiasts insist that the anonymous whale enacted the move to diversify their portfolios and gain big in the upcoming bull market later this year. Others believe that the whale wants to sell off the majority of their holdings and probably settle some of the debts they accrued. However, whichever the case may be, a click on the web link to the eye-catching transaction shows that the anonymous transaction was made from a Coinbase Institutional account to a new project, ETFSwap (ETFS), firmly believed to be Ethereum’s biggest presale. ETFSwap (ETFS) Becomes Ethereum’s Biggest Presale Like the anonymous whale that bought a large amount of the ETFSwap (ETFS) presale tokens, thousands of crypto investors are still flooding into the presale, with over 50 million tokens already sold out in what is now believed to be Ethereum’s biggest pressale. This reiterates the fact that the crypto community believes in the viability and genuineness of the ETFSwap (ETFS) platform. ETFSwap (ETFS) is an Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that enables users and investors to buy, trade efficiently, and own a wide variety of cryptocurrencies and tokenized exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a one-stop shop. This innovative platform has come at a time when the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs) is being embraced in the cryptocurrency world. At the forefront of this niche, ETFSwap (ETFS) users and investors enjoy the benefits provided by the innovation and flexibility of the decentralized finance realm while trading their various assets. With the market-making and perpetual futures services available on the platform, trading is fun, seamless, liquid, and efficient on ETFSwap (ETFS). Consequently, users and investors are assured of continuous trading activities without any expiration dates. Users can also take absolute advantage of the leverage tool on the platform. The ETFSwap (ETFS) platform enables users and investors to amplify their gains with the 10x leverage option provided. This tool is great for seasoned investors who want to maximize their gains by up to 1,000%, meaning a $1,000 gain can easily be turned into a $10,000 gain. Another feature that has swept crypto enthusiasts off their feet is that on ETFSwap (ETFS), users and investors are not required to undergo rigorous KYC verification. They are afforded the platform to trade anonymously. This will, in return, absolve them of any third-party interference, such as banks or regulated bodies. Additionally, CyberScope, a leading blockchain security provider, has audited ETFSwap’s (ETFS) smart contracts, and the results show their resistance to cyberattacks.  Whale’s Investment In The ETFSwap (ETFS) Presale Sends Crypto Community Into A Buying Frenzy After the whale invested a large amount of his withdrawal from Coinbase into the ETFSwap (ETFS) presale, the platform has seen major market activity, with investors actively buying the token. Presently, in Stage 1 of the presale, the ETFS token is priced at $0.00854 and is selling fast due to this being the lowest price the token will ever be. Therefore, there is no better time to invest in the highly esteemed ETFSwap (ETFS) project than now, especially after analysts have predicted it will go parabolic when the bull run begins.

Cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift founder Erik Voorhees announced on Friday the public launch of his latest venture, Venice AI, a privacy-focused generative AI chatbot. Privacy is a critical concern for the cryptocurrency space and among artificial intelligence users—a crucial factor in the creation of Venice AI, he said. “I saw where AI is going, which is to be captured by large tech companies that are in bed with the government,” Voorhees told Decrypt. “And that really worried me, and I see how powerful AI is, how consequential it can be—an amazing realm of new technologies.” Large tech companies are often under the thumb of government and act as gatekeepers to AI, Voorhees lamented, something that could lead us into a dystopian world. “The antidote to that is open-source decentralization,” Voorhees said. “Not giving monopoly power over this stuff to anyone.” Acknowledging the important work done by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google in pushing the field of generative AI forward, Voorhees said consumers should still have the choice to use open-source AI. “I don't want that to be the only option; I don't want the only option to be closed source, proprietary, centralized, censored, permissioned,” he said. “So, alternatives need to exist.” Voorhees launched the ShapeShift cryptocurrency exchange in 2014. In July 2021, the exchange said it would transition to an open-source decentralized exchange (DEX), with control of the exchange transferring from Voorhees to the ShapeShift DAO. ShapeShift announced in March that it would shut down after becoming embroiled in a battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The exchange agreed to pay a $275,000 fine and abide by a cease-and-desist order to settle allegations that the exchange allowed users to trade digital assets without registering as a broker or exchange with the agency. In the intervening three years, Voorhees said he had turned his attention to building a permissionless, decentralized AI model. Venice AI does not store user data and can’t see user conversations, Voorhees said, explaining that Venice AI sends users’ text input through an encrypted proxy server to a decentralized GPU that runs the AI model, which then sends the answer back. “The whole point of that is for security,” Voorhees said. Announcing Venice Today, we launch private, permissionless AI for the purpose of unfettered civilizational advancement: https://t.co/m2jsJuDuXS Full announcement:https://t.co/lPIDpgI9K1@TryVenice A thread... 1/17 — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) May 10, 2024  “[The GPU] does see the plain text of the specific prompt, but it doesn't see all your other conversations, and Venice doesn't see your conversations, and none of it is tied to your identity,” he said. Voorhees acknowledged that the system does not provide perfect privacy—it is not completely anonymous and zero knowledge, but expressed the view that Venice AI’s model is “substantially better” than the status quo, where conversations are sent to and stored by a centralized company. “They see all of it, and they have it all forever, and they tie it to your identity,” Voorhees said. AI developers like Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta have worked strenuously to improve public and policymaker perceptions of the generative AI industry. Several of the top AI firms have signed onto government, and non-profit initiatives and pledges to develop “responsible AI.” These services ostensibly allow users to delete their chat history, but Voorhees says it's naive to assume the data is gone forever. “Once a company has your information, you can never trust it’s gone, ever,” he said, noting that some government regulations require companies to retain customer information. “People should assume that everything they write to OpenAI is going to them and that they have it forever.” “The only way to resolve that is by using a service where the information does not go to a central repository at all in the first place,” Voorhees added. “That's what we tried to build.” On the Venice AI’s platform, chat history is stored locally in the user’s browser and can be deleted, whether the user creates an account or not. Customers can set up an account with an Apple ID, Gmail, Email, Discord, or by connecting a MetaMask wallet. There are advantages to creating a Venice AI account, however, including higher message limits, modifying prompts, and earning points—although points don't currently serve any function apart from making it easier to track usage. Users looking for more even features can also pay for a Venice Pro account, currently priced at $49 annually. Venice Pro provides unlimited text prompts, removes watermarks from generated images and document uploads, and allows users to “turn off Safe Mode for unhindered image generation.” Fun with https://t.co/m2jsJuDuXS In Venice (with a Pro account), you can modify the \"System Prompt.\" This is basically like god mode or root access over the LLM with which you're interacting. It can enable interesting perspectives that normal AI services would censor. pic.twitter.com/qlt0xp0aC9 — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) May 10, 2024  Despite the MetaMask account integration, Voorhees noted that users cannot yet subscribe to Venice Pro with digital currencies—but said it is “coming soon.” Meanwhile, because it is built atop the Morpheus Network, the company is rewarding holders of the Morpheus token. ”If you have one Morpheus token in your wallet, you get a free pro account indefinitely,” he said. “You don't even have to pay, you just hold one Morpheus token and you automatically have the Pro account as long as that token is in your wallet.” As they do with any tool, cybercriminals persistently develop ways to circumvent the guardrails built into AI tools to harness them to commit crimes, whether via using obscure languages or creating illicit clones of popular AI models. However, according to Voorhees, interacting with a language calculator is never illegal. “If you were to go on Google and search for ‘how do I make a bomb?’ you can go find that information—it's not illegal to go find that information, and I don't think it's unethical to find that information,” he said. “What is illegal and unethical is if you build a bomb to hurt people, but that has nothing to do with Google. “That's a separate action that the user is taking. so Venice in particular, or AI is generally, I think a similar principle applies,” he said. Generative AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have also come under increased scrutiny over how AI models are trained, where the data is stored, and privacy concerns. Venice AI collects limited information, like how the product is used—creating new chats, for example—but its website says the platform cannot see or store “any data about the text or image prompts shared between you and the AI models.” For its text generation, Venice uses the Llama 3 large language model, which was developed by Facebook parent company Meta. Customers can also switch between two Llama 3 versions: Nous H2P and Dolphin 2.9. In a Twitter Spaces after the launch of Venice AI, Voorhees praised the work Mark Zuckerberg and Meta have done in generative AI, including making the powerful LLM open source. “Meta deserves tremendous credit for essentially spending hundreds of millions of dollars to train a cutting-edge model and just releasing it for free to the world,” he said. Venice also allows users to generate images using open-source models Playground v2.5, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, and Segmind Stable Diffusion 1B. When asked if Venice AI would use services from OpenAI or Anthropic, Voorhees’ response was an emphatic no. “We will never provide Claude LLM and never provide OpenAI's service,” he said. “We're not a wrapper for centralized services, we are a way to access open-source models explicitly and only.” With Venice AI built atop the decentralized Morpheus network that powers open-source smart agents, Voorhees acknowledged that there are concerns about Venice AI’s performance. It's something they're focused on, he explained. “If we want to bring private, uncensored AI to people, it has to be roughly as performant as centralized companies,” Voorhees said. “Because if it's not, people are going to prefer the convenience of the central company.” Edited by Ryan Ozawa.

Schwartz, renowned for his contributions to cryptography and as one of the original architects of XRP Ledger, along with Arthur Britto and Jed McCaleb, responded to questions about his purported identity as Nakamoto with a firm denial. He clarified that while he possessed the requisite skill set, he only became aware of Bitcoin in 2011, well after its inception, stating that he wished he had discovered it earlier.   His assertion stemmed from his admission that his introduction to Bitcoin occurred relatively late, and he also emphasized his unfamiliarity with the Qt interface, a crucial aspect of the early Bitcoin code, which further distanced him from any association with Nakamoto. The only skill I'm missing is that I don't know Qt. But I'm pretty sure @nbougalis knows Qt. So if you want to speculate that Nik and I are Satoshi (or are two of the Satoshi four or whatever) it's plausible. Not true, but it's plausible. Following the conference, Schwartz took to social media to expand on his stance, indicating humorously that the only skill he lacked in order to be Nakamoto was familiarity with Qt. However, he noted that Nik Bougalis, Ripple's former director of engineering, had the requisite knowledge, sparking speculation.   Schwartz's statement, that it is \"not True, but plausible\" regarding any potential association with Satoshi Nakamoto, has reignited discussions within the cryptocurrency community.

Blockchain fixes this.","Chuyên mục":"Op-Ed","Tác giả":"Sean (Xiang) Ren","Ngày tạo":"May 9, 2024 09:39 am","Tags":"Artificial Intelligence blockchain cryptocurrency","Nội dung":"Crypto and blockchain can provide a safer, fairer, more human-centric collaboration between AI and the rest of us Artwork by Crystal Le share Many Americans got their first glimpse behind the machine learning curtain when details of Amazon’s “Just Walk Out” technology went public. Instead of pure technology tallying up customers’ purchases and charging them when they left the store, the sales were manually checked by about 1,000 real people working in India. But these workers were the human-half of what most AI really is — a collaboration between reinforcement learning and human intelligence. The human element tends to be ignored in discussions of AI safety, which is a little disturbing given how much of an impact AI will likely have on our job markets and ultimately our individual lives. This is where decentralization, the inherent trustlessness and security of blockchain technology can play a major role. The Center for Safe AI identifies four broad categories of AI risk. As a start, there’s malicious use, in which users might “intentionally harness powerful AIs to cause widespread harm” by engineering “new pandemics or [using them] for propaganda, censorship and surveillance, or [releasing AIs] to autonomously pursue harmful goals.” A more subtle concern is the risk of an AI race, where corporations or nation states compete to quickly build more powerful systems and take unacceptable risks in the process. Unchecked cyberwarfare is a potential outcome, another is allowing systems to evolve on their own, potentially slipping out of human control; or a more prosaic, but no less disruptive outcome, could be mass unemployment from unchecked competition. Organizational risks with AI are similar to any other industry. AI could cause serious industrial accidents, or powerful programs could be stolen or copied by malicious actors. Finally, there’s the risk that the AIs themselves could go rogue, “optimizing flawed objectives, drifting from their original goals, becoming power-seeking, resisting shutdown or engaging in deception.” Regulation and good governance can contain many of these risks. Malicious use is addressed by restricting queries and access to various features, and the court system could be used to hold developers accountable. Risks of rogue AI or and organizational issues can be mitigated by common sense and fostering a safety-conscious approach to using AI. But these approaches don’t address some of the second-order effects of AI. Namely, centralization and the perverse incentives remaining from legacy Web2 companies. For too long, we’ve traded our private information for access to tools. You can opt out, but it’s a pain for most users. AI is no different than any other algorithm, in that what you get out of it is the direct result of what you put in — and there are already massive amounts of resources devoted to cleaning up and preparing data to be used for AI. A good example is OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which is trained on hundreds of billions of lines of text taken from books, blogs and communities like Reddit and Wikipedia, but also relies on people and smaller, more customized databases to fine-tune the output. Read more from our opinion section: What can blockchain do for AI? Not what you’ve heard. This brings up a number of issues. Mark Cuban has recently pointed out that AI will eventually need to be trained on data that companies and individuals might not want to share, in order to become more commercially useful beyond coding and copywriting. And, as more jobs are impacted by AI — particularly as AI agents make custom AI applications accessible — the labor market as we know it could eventually implode. Creating a blockchain layer in a decentralized AI network could mitigate these problems. We can build AI that can track the provenance of data, maintain privacy and allow individuals and enterprises to charge for access to their specialized data if we use decentralized identities, validation staking, consensus and roll-up technologies like optimistic and zero-knowledge proofs. This could shift the balance away from large, opaque, centralized institutions and provide individuals and enterprises with an entirely new economic system. On the technological front, you need a way to confirm the integrity of data, the ownership of data and its legitimacy (model auditing). Then, you would need a method of provenance, (to borrow a phrase from the art world), which means being able to see any piece of data’s audit trail in order to properly compensate whoever’s data is being used. Privacy is also important — a user must be able to secure their data on their own electronics and be able to control access to their data, including being able to revoke that access. Doing so involves cryptography and a security protection certification system. This is an advancement from the existing system, where valuable information is merely collected and sold to centralized AI companies. Instead, it enables broad participation in AI development. Individuals can engage in various roles, such as creating AI agents, supplying specialized data or offering intermediary services like data labeling. Others might contribute by managing infrastructure, operating nodes or providing validation services. This inclusive approach allows for a more diversified and collaborative AI ecosystem. We could create a system that benefits everyone in the system, from the digital clerics a continent away to the shoppers whose cart contents provide them raw data to developers behind the scenes. Crypto can provide a safer, fairer, more human-centric collaboration between AI and the rest of us. "},

In a detailed analysis, JPMorgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, have expressed confidence that the recent Wells notice issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to Robinhood Crypto for alleged unregistered security offerings will not prevent the approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  This report from JPMorgan highlights an important point: the SEC's action against Robinhood is part of a broader, assertive approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, treating them as securities except for Bitcoin and Ether.  However, the team clarified:  \"In our opinion, it does not look like the Wells notice should pose an obstacle to an eventual approval by the SEC of spot Ethereum ETFs, although perhaps not as soon as this month.\"  This perspective indicates that while immediate approval is unlikely, the path remains open for future approval. The analysts draw a parallel with the Bitcoin ETF scenario, where after initial rejections, futures-based ETFs were approved, setting a legal and regulatory precedent. They argue that a similar trajectory could be expected for Ethereum.  Should the SEC deny the spot ETFs for Ethereum, it might face legal challenges that could potentially end in favor of the ETF proponents, much as it occurred with Bitcoin.  Worth noting, the SEC's Wells Notice to Robinhood importantly does not classify Ethereum as a security. This omission leaves Ethereum's regulatory classification to future legislation and court rulings.  Panigirtzoglou suggests that Ethereum might eventually be categorized in a \"middle\" area between commodities and securities, reflecting its unique position in the digital asset landscape. Despite potential regulatory hurdles, the market might not be greatly affected if a spot Ether ETF is not approved soon.  JPMorgan notes that the current discount on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust indicates a lack of immediate market interest in Ethereum ETFs. Moreover, Grayscale has withdrawn its application for an Ether futures ETF, likely opting to focus on converting its existing Ethereum trust into a spot ETF, indicating a move towards more favorable regulatory conditions.

Fresh cash has started hitting Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) again after five weeks of outflows. A Monday report from European asset manager CoinShares shows $130 million entering the funds last week. CoinShares tracks all crypto funds from the U.S. to Europe and Australia. Most of last week's movements entered American funds, particularly the new spot ETFs that give traditional stock investors exposure to Bitcoin. The report added that European investors pulled $14 million out of Ethereum-related funds due to bearish sentiment surrounding the approval of an Ethereum ETF. A number of high-profile investment firms are hoping to get approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an Ethereum ETF, but experts think the regulator will drag its heels in giving such products the green light—if they're approved at all. “Low interaction by the U.S. regulators with ETF issuer applications for a spot Ethereum ETF have increased speculation that the ETF approval is not imminent,” CoinShares wrote. “This has been reflected in outflows which totalled $14 million last week.” Perhaps the best news for investors who are long on Bitcoin is that the amount of money leaving Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) last week was the lowest it has been since its conversion to an ETF in January. Since shifting from a closed-end fund model to an ETF, investors have aggressively redeemed shares to cash out of the product—either to look for a cheaper ETF or take home gains. As the fund sells its Bitcoin to pay customers cash, these massive outflows have put downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. But at the start of this month, for the first time, more investors started buying GBTC shares than redeeming them. GBTC inflows could lead to the price of the asset going up if more investors want exposure to the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, CoinShares said. Bitcoin is now trading for $62,810 per coin, CoinGecko says. It touched a new all-time high in March of nearly $74,000 but has since struggled due to dying ETF hype. Just a fortnight ago, the Bitcoin ETFs had their worst day on record, with investors pulling out more than half a billion dollars. Could investors be hungry for Bitcoin again? Edited by Ryan Ozawa.

The halving, which marks the fourth such event in bitcoin’s history, will knock rewards down to 3.125 BTC per block from 6.25. However, a lot has changed since the last time the rewards were halved in 2020 from the launch of the spot bitcoin ETFs to bitcoin notching new all-time highs just last month. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe sat down with Blockworks ahead of the halving to discuss the overall market environment, bitcoin and the launch of the ETFs. Read more: ETFs helped ‘legitimize’ bitcoin ahead of halving: Q&A Keep reading for excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Belshe. Blockworks: How is BitGo approaching the space post-bitcoin ETFs? Mike Belshe: What we have found, as an industry, in the last year and a half to two and a half years, is that there’s a political thing going on that is influencing the interpretation of laws and regulations. And because of that, the traditional players are largely locked out. But all of a sudden, they’ve got the ETF vehicle, which has been approved. It’s the one shining light that they can definitely use without feeling like they’re putting their entire businesses at risk. It allows them to participate in Bitcoin, to provide access to their own clients for Bitcoin, and yet not necessarily have to take all of the exposures that they would have to take if they tried to do what BitGo does. So instead, they lean on BitGo to make that happen. Blockworks: You guys have direct exposure to ETFs, correct? Belshe: So we’re handling two of them so far. I think there are many more that you’ll be hearing about very soon. We provide all the regulatory compliance that [bitcoin ETF issuers] would need to expect. We’re regulated in three different states as a Trust Company. We’ve got South Dakota, New York and Wyoming now. And then, of course, we have money transmission licenses and other things that we do so we’re a very easy player for anybody that’s looking for that secure storage to work with. Blockworks: Can you give some insight into the conversations that you’re having with these institutions following the spot bitcoin ETF launches? Belshe: The business this year is just growing so fast. I actually think the institutions aren’t as much in as you would think. We have our existing institutional clients, and they’re all going to retail on their own — and that retail demand has been growing. Some people are asking, ‘Where is this ETF demand coming from?’ And I think it’s still mostly retail demand — that is, retail clients going through Schwab, through TD Ameritrade. They’re going through their brokers and just now getting access to this asset class, which previously was just too hard to touch. Read more: The 2024 halving could usher in a new era for Bitcoin Now they just log in and buy. This is actually very good news for the industry, because there’s an endless amount of institutional demand, which we know is coming. So institutions are not yet in, and I believe they are coming, but the ETF was only approved in January…it’s not enough time for those evaluations to have been completed yet, which is why most of what we see so far is retail coming in. There’s some amount of the small hedge funds that are now coming in some amount of RAs can come in because they can make faster decisions and move quickly. And I think there’s a lot of headroom here for more demand. Blockworks: We’ve heard similar things from Valkyrie, that some financial advisors, etc. are not quite ready to embrace the ETFs just yet, and that they need more time. Are you hearing similar rumblings? Belshe: Some just need to see how bitcoin ETFs play out. The [Securities and Exchange Commission] was initially a no. Now they approved the products, but it’s not like these guys were like, ‘Great, the [bitcoin ETFs] are ready to go.’ A lot of them were on the sidelines, and now — even with the ETFs being launched — they need to see how it all shakes out. Is it all going to go to BlackRock or to Fidelity, or heck, is Bitwise going to get some of this? Is it going to be really unstable? Is it going to get big really fast?

People are now looking at it and saying, ‘Yeah, this is a pretty robust ecosystem, the largest, fastest-growing ETF sector in the history of the market.’ Blockworks: Is this going to be a different halving than what we’ve seen before because of all the outside factors? Belshe: I don’t tend to think about it in the short term. But long term, what is it really? Well, we have a distribution schedule for how new bitcoin [is] issued out into the world. That was put in motion all the way back in 2009. It hasn’t changed. That, by the way, is the first monetary policy in the history of humans that has been static for 15 years straight. Humans can’t stop tinkering — the Fed changes things every quarter — and yet Bitcoin has managed to hold it steady by the exact same schedule that was put in place in 2009. It just shows the difference between what happens when you hand the rules over to the machines versus the emotions of people. Read more: Financial trouble for bitcoin miners: A look back, and ahead as the halving looms You could ask the question: Why does it work this way? And that gets more into how do you build a currency of value without just giving yourself all the tokens. There are other currencies out there, like XRP, where Ripple gives themselves all the money to begin with, and then they say, ‘Come buy my coin.’ Alright, maybe some people are gonna do that and they’ve been fairly successful. Ripple still holds a chunk of XRP to this day. But it’s a lot harder to trust that, because you’re so dependent on Ripple and good stewardship of XRP. And I’m not trying to say they haven’t been good stewards. I think they’ve been reasonably good. But with Bitcoin, they didn’t want that. So instead, Satoshi Nakamoto put together this thing. I think it builds trust, and this is going to be just another milestone in building trust. Bitcoin is the one asset that’s going to do exactly what it said it was going to do, and not falter from the original plan. This interview was edited for brevity and clarity. "},

In recent times, more charges have been brought against Avraham Eisenberg, the individual who was involved in the theft of 110 million dollars from the decentralised financial system known as Mango Markets. Eisenberg, who was previously found guilty of fraud and market manipulation in connection with the crime, is now facing an accusation of having child pornography. This accusation comes after Eisenberg was previously found guilty of the theft. As a result of the allegations that were brought against Eisenberg, it was revealed that he had sexually graphic photographs of children saved on his various computing devices. During a search that took place in January of 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the United States of America made the first discovery of these photographs. Several of the images that Eisenberg had taken were said to have featured prepubescent children who were less than 12 years old, according to the charges that were made in the court documents, which were dated April 3, 2024 but were not made public until April 26, 2024. For the purpose of conducting more investigations into the possession and receipt of child pornography, the government made an application for a second warrant in February 2023, and it was granted. This was done so that they could conduct more investigations. As a consequence of this request, which resulted in an expansion of the first search warrant's scope, the police were able to search for more evidence concerning the possession and receipt of child pornography. One of the most important things to keep in mind is that the allegations that have been made against Eisenberg have not been proven in court. Christopher Brunet, an investigative journalist, claims that he has screenshots that show Eisenberg \"talking about children in really disgusting ways\". Brunet's assertions are contrary to the rest of the information shown here. "},

Navigating The AI Convergence Of Tech With Nvidia","Chuyên mục":"Forbes Forbes Digital Assets","Tác giả":"Sandy Carter","Ngày tạo":"May 14, 2024,","Tags":"Không có","Nội dung":"SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 18: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address during the ... [+] Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California. The developer conference is expected to highlight new chip, software, and AI processor technology. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The word 'exponential' is one of the most abused in the English language, but in the world of technology it retains its true meaning of constantly accelerating change. This exponential growth isn’t confined to isolated pockets or a handful of industries; it’s systemic, engulfing every technology-dependent industry. Which is to say, practically all of them. But today we have a massive set of technology converging all at the same time including AI, Quantum, Spatial, Blockchain, and more. All of these technologies underpin the surging wave that is shaping the new norm of our era - a period I like to call 'Exponential Baby.' If we are to seize the opportunities and avoid the dangers of this growth, we need a similar rapid augmentation in our understanding of these technologies. The world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides a clear illustration of this growth pattern. According to Gartner, a staggering 80% of enterprises anticipate increasing their use of generational AI by 2024. These aren’t incremental upticks; these are massive leaps in adoption. NVIDIA stands as a testament to this movement, now valued as a two-trillion dollar company largely due to their pivotal role in powering AI operations. Their success isn't a solo journey – they’re marching alongside giants like Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and Amazon. Their soaring chipset shipments is just one indicator of the growth trajectory we’re on. Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, has expressed significant insights on the growth of AI and its implications. He acknowledges a \"major second wave\" of AI, propelled by the recognition of the need for sovereign AI that reflects the unique cultural and linguistic characteristics of each region, and the widespread adoption of AI across various industries. TAIPEI, TAIWAN - 2023/06/01: Jensen Huang, President of NVIDIA holding the Grace hopper superchip ... [+] CPU used for generative AI at supermicro keynote presentation during the COMPUTEX 2023. The COMPUTEX 2023 runs from 30 May to 02 June 2023 and gathers over 1,000 exhibitors from 26 different countries with 3000 booths to display their latest products and to sign orders with foreign buyers. (Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Huang sees NVIDIA's advanced computing platforms as instrumental in driving this growth, noting that \"NVIDIA are going to bring a ton of technology to networking\" and that the exponential increase in compute throughput will span nearly 1,000 times in just a couple of years. This rapid development is not just contained within AI but extends to areas like inference computing, which now exceeds all cloud CPUs in aggregate, demonstrating NVIDIA's significant role in fueling AI-powered consumer services. Huang's vision is both a lesson and warning for every business that uses technology: as we move into the twin Ages of AI and Decentralization, every technological development is interlinked and contributes to an overarching acceleration and intensification of AI capabilities and applications across the globe. This has, needless to say, fundamental implications for long-cherished organizational mindsets and business models. For example, take AI’s contribution to productivity is a narrative that disrupts traditional labor conversations. We once fretted about AI’s potential to displace blue-collar jobs. Yet, reality portrays a more complex canvas where 46% of office legal work is automated. In a mere year, AI-driven automation spiked by 25%. And when ChatGPT arrived, it exemplified how rapidly AI could capture public attention and utility, amassing a user base that other platforms took decades to build. Share of work that can be automated by the AI Industry by Goldman Sachs But just as we begin to comprehend AI’s impact on every role, department and organization, the technology makes another exponential leap. Alongside the explosive growth in AI, we're also witnessing a remarkable convergence in the field of spatial computing. This encompasses augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and other technologies that enable digital and physical realities to coalesce. The pace of change is staggering. Companies like NVIDIA are leveraging their expertise in AI to push the boundaries of spatial computing, making it faster and more integrated into our daily lives. This convergence is not just technical but experiential, dramatically altering how we interact with data, entertainment, and each other. Innovations in hardware, such as more powerful GPUs, and software, like sophisticated spatial algorithms, are changing the nature of digital interactions, which are fast becoming as intuitive and natural as physical ones. As spatial computing becomes more mainstream, its integration with AI will only deepen, paving the way for fully immersive experiences that are seamlessly integrated into various sectors—from gaming and entertainment to education and telepresence. How are enterprises implementing AI? Scale AI just released their \"AI Readiness\" report where they surveyed 1800+ practitioners building or applying AI solutions in enterprises. Programming is the most popular use case, hence Venture Capitalist (VC) are leading very large rounds in companies like Cognition, Augment and Codeium. Codeium was recently recognized by Forbes as part of their AI 50 list, the only AI code assistant to be included. Scale AI survey of 1800+ Ai and machine learning practitioners building or applying AI solutions in ... [+] Enterprises. As Varun Mohan, the CEO of Codeium, told me, “To deliver a product that is truly valuable to a developer in a professional setting, we've realized that more than just the state of the art LLMs, you need widespread platform availability, agnostic integrations across internal knowledge stores, and adherence to enterprise security and compliance standards, especially while case law is still being developed. Today, most tools provide targeted acceleration but we envision a world where AI will help solve the hardest problems in all parts of the software development cycle.\" Using AI in coding, particularly at Codeium, exemplifies its ability to enhance personalization and efficiency. AI coding assistants excel by integrating deep contextual insights, such as the specific third-party libraries and internal documentation relevant to a developer's project. \"Context is king,\" as noted by one expert, highlighting that the more contextual data provided, the more accurate and useful the AI's output. This personalized approach not only streamlines the coding process but also ensures that the solutions are uniquely tailored to the developer's needs, significantly boosting productivity. Varun Mohan, CEO of Codeium The implication of this trend for businesses and individuals is profound. It means not only rethinking user interfaces but also reimagining how we collaborate and interact in workspaces that are no longer bound by geography. The convergence of AI and spatial computing will revolutionize industries, leading to an acceleration in remote work capabilities, training procedures, and even altering the landscape of social interactions. Leaders and organizations that understand and leverage this convergence will likely be at the forefront of the next wave of digital transformation. In addition to AI, cryptocurrency's rebound speaks volumes about the fast-changing landscape of asset valuation. Crypto has risen from its ashes to become a leading asset class, ballooning in value at an astonishing pace, with prices now driven by hugely increased utility, rather than just speculation. The chart below from Bitwise Asset Management with data from Bloomberg Data shows that Bitcoin has led in performance 10 of the last 13 years. Bitwise Asset Management with data from Bloomberg Data shows Bitcoin performance from 2011 through ... [+] 2023. Perhaps the most mind-boggling of all trends is the anticipated growth in data. Over the next decade, data will burgeon by approximately 660 zettabytes. To put that into perspective, it equates to around 610 more 128GB iPhones for every person on the planet. Dealing with this data deluge is a challenge for the tech industry, but leaders in every sector must keep pace, too. How can they navigate the convergence of technology and the exponential growth in its capability, and what lessons must they learn to stay ahead of the game? The challenge posed by this whirling vortex of growth lies not in riding the wave but in steering through it effectively. Change management becomes pivotal. It's about helping teams navigate through the innovation influx while fostering an environment ripe for adaptation and learning. Empathy becomes as crucial a tool as any software – understanding that while machines may not experience job insecurity, humans certainly do. It’s encouraging to see stories of dental hygienists who proactively educate themselves in AI, recognizing that these skills are integral to their evolving roles. These actions epitomize the mindset shift required for the workforce of tomorrow. In the workplace of the future, leadership and lessons can come from the unlikeliest places, rather than the hierarchical, top-down models to which we’ve become long-accustomed. Education must flow in both directions, with teams and leaders embracing dialogue, openness, and a willingness to experiment. ISTANBUL, TURKEY - MAY 06: A woman views historical documents and photographs displayed in a high ... [+] tech art installation at Salt Galata on May 6, 2017 in Istanbul, Turkey. The \"Archive Dreaming\" installation by artist Refik Anadol uses artificial intelligence to visualize nearly 2 million historical Ottoman documents and photographs from the SALT Research Archive. Controlled by a single tablet in the center of a mirrored room the artist used machine learning algorithms to combine historical documents, art, graphics and photographs to create an immersive installation allowing people to scroll, read and explore the archives. The SALT Galata archives include around 1.7 million documents ranging from the late-Ottoman era to the present day. The exhibition is on show at SALT Galata art space through till June 11, 2017. (Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images) What's evident is that the pace of technological change isn't going to plateau – it’s set to accelerate. The exponential trend is here to stay, and it's not exclusive to AI. The ripple effects are felt across blockchain, machine learning, and IoT, to name a few. With each converging technology, new possibilities and challenges emerge. Navigating these trends necessitates a leadership style that's dynamic, inclusive, and forward-thinking. Change management, empathy, and education form the triad of essential skills. The goal is to cultivate a culture where innovation is not just reacted to but anticipated and embraced. ‘Exponential Baby’ isn't just a trend; it's a paradigm shift in the technological and corporate landscape. As AI continues to evolve, and data swells to previously unimaginable levels, leaders must adapt their strategies to keep pace. This era is a test of our agility, our foresight, and our willingness to engage with technology not as a tool, but as an integral part of our evolving humanity. We stand at the threshold of the exponential age – an era of immense potential, profound change, and boundless opportunity. As leaders, educators, and individuals, our task is to harness this potential, surf the wave of change, and emerge resilient and ready for the world of tomorrow.  One Community. Many Voices.

First investors of the fund include Nexus Mutual, a crypto insurance alternative provider, with a $15 million allocation and the RWA-focused Vista fund of Ava Labs, an ecosystem developer organization of Avalanche, with a smaller deposit. The company also raised $7 million in venture capital in its latest fundraising round led by Electric Capital, following a $14 million seed round in late 2022. Re, which is regulated in the Cayman Islands, focuses on introducing blockchain tech for a traditionally opaque, conservative industry and aims to be a decentralized version of Lloyd's of London, though of as the premier marketplace for insurance. Reinsurance companies offer protection for insurance firms, collecting premiums to cover certain types of risks. With nearly $1 trillion in premiums annually, reinsurance is a cornerstone of today's financial markets and commerce, Karn Saroya, chief executive officer of Re said in an interview with CoinDesk. \"Reinsurance is the ocean, and insurance companies are the boats floating on the water,” he said. Bringing these assets to blockchain rails can improve settlements, operational efficiency and create greater transparency of capital reserves, Saroya explained. This is in line with the red-hot tokenization trend, with digital asset firms and global financial institutions such as BlackRock, Citi and Franklin Templeton creating digital versions of old-school investments – often referred to as RWAs – to trade them on blockchains for operational benefits. Read more: Why Asset Tokenization Is Inevitable In the beginning, Re's new fund backs more conservative, low-volatility insurances such as property, trucking, aviation and workers compensation, excluding catastrophic risks, Karoya said. The fund targets to offer up to 23% annualized yield to investors, and is accessible to U.S. accredited investors and any investors outside the U.S. who complete Re's know-your-customer (KYC) process. The minimum lock-up period for deposits is one year, and funds are available for redemptions as collateral is released from the insurance companies. Investing in the fund is similar to high-yield fixed income, Saroya said, making it attractive to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and ecosystem funds to deploy capital. "},

There is visible growth among some of the most prominent sectors of the crypto ecosystem, however, decentralized finance (DeFi) seems to be lagging. Observing this anomaly, Patrick Hansen, Circle’s Senior Policy Director for Europe, advocated that the sector needs a complete overhaul. According to the observation from Hansen, the DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) has remained at the same level it was at over three years ago. According to Hansen, this metric is even less than half of what it is if the Liquid Staking capital lockup is excluded. DeFi needs a new wave of innovation and apps. Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols - admittedly a flawed metric - is at the same level it was over 3 years ago and less than half what it was at the end of 2021 if you exclude liquid staking. pic.twitter.com/JGZufQMO6z   Per data from DeFiLlama, the DeFi TVL is currently pegged at $142.347 billion, down by more than $220 billion as of December 2021. This massive slump comes despite a growing number of dApps on Ethereum (ETH) and other protocols with deep connections to smart contract finance applications. For an industry that is evolving outward, Patrick Hansen suggests there should be a major difference in the locked TVL. While the policy expert noted that the TVL is a flawed metric for judging holistic market performance, he noted that DeFi needs a new wave of innovations and applications overall. The focus of traders on the market notably shifted over the past few years to Ethereum restaking protocols. This is the major aspect of the DeFi ecosystem that recorded a significant uptick, with Lido DAO and EigenLayer leading the charge in this regard. The intention to innovate may, however, face a major strain on the market moving forward. This is based on the harsh regulatory climate in the United States, the major liquidity market for DeFi.

BONK and Adobe Stock modified by Blockworks share What are brand-new projects to do in such a topsy-turvy market, one that’s either teetering on the brink of altcoin season or about to veer off into another crypto winter? It’s been about seven months since a fake news tweet from Cointelegraph pushed crypto into overdrive. The market is clearly still confused. The salacious tweet — which reported that the SEC had approved spot bitcoin ETFs for US markets — confirmed a major bitcoin rally that had been brewing all through 2023. Bitcoin surged by two-thirds in the months between the post and official SEC approval in early January, and then by another 80% after the fact. Crypto has since been outright messy. Memecoin, DePIN and computing marketplace projects have pumped, privacy coins have dumped, and ETH is stuck in no-man’s land awaiting approval of its own spot ETFs a la BlackRock’s IBIT. As Jason touches on in today’s Empire podcast episode, creative ways of issuing new tokens have emerged between this cycle and the last. Startups and protocol stewards commonly run private token sales in funding rounds with venture capitalists — which apparently don’t piss off the SEC — before airdropping slices of the circulating supply to users and other early adopters (read: those pesky airdrop farmers). No ICO means no SEC lawsuits, the thinking goes, while the supply ends up with folks who actively use the protocols they power. Seems like a win-win. A byproduct of this New Style of doing crypto business is that token supplies are often drip-dropped into the market over a number of years. It’s now relatively routine for tokens to launch with less than 25% of the supply circulating — and in some cases much less. The rest is kept by the team, early backers and other insiders to fund development, marketing and, eventually, provide ROI. What results is a number of low-float tokens with massively high fully-diluted valuations compared to their actual market caps, a blueprint largely perfected by Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research with Serum and other “Sam Coins.” It all begs the question of whether there’s any correlation between price performance and low-float supply dynamics. There are individual cases: dYdX, for instance, had only 18% of the supply circulating when Cointelegraph’s fake news tweet confirmed the bitcoin bull market and has since released an additional 34% of the supply. dYdX’s price against bitcoin has collapsed by more than half in that time. The airdropped Starknet token is another — it only has 7.3% circulating supply and its bitcoin ratio has also halved. But after analyzing the current top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, as well as another two dozen or so tokens featured in the top 100 just before the bitcoin bull run really kicked off, broader correlation is harder to find. Tokens at the top of the chart have high floats. Tokens to the right of the dotted line have beaten bitcoin. Brighter circles have increased their supplies more than darker ones. And larger circles have grown bigger market caps. After removing a few outliers, about 40% of the top end of the market have outperformed bitcoin since October. At that time, the median circulating supply for tokens that have gone onto beat bitcoin was 70%. For underperformers, it was 79%. Not exactly a huge difference. Low float cryptocurrencies generally did as well as high floats. Then, the median performance against bitcoin for tokens with circulating supplies of 80% or more was minus 21%. So, high-float tokens appear just as susceptible to losing significant ground as low-floats. Even projects with some of the lowest floats — 19 tokens with under 25% of the supply circulating — on average have beaten BTC by 25%, while the median was almost 1% ahead. But for standout performers, there does appear to be a link. Bitcoin ratios of nearly a dozen top cryptocurrencies have more than tripled since October. Their median circulating supply was 94% before the rally. All those stars were memecoins and DePIN projects, which aside from Bittensor, all had a large majority of their supplies already circulating. A great irony of crypto in 2024 is that perhaps, it’s time to treat memecoin launches as the new standard moving forward. — David Canellis He’s back. I am, of course, talking about the man, the myth, the legend: Roaring Kitty. The return of Keith Gill, the man behind the powerful online persona, sent memestocks and memecoins soaring on Monday. We were left asking one big question: Is history repeating itself? The answer is…maybe? We’re nowhere near the 2021 memestock mania, when GameStop’s stock rose to new heights. And it’s not just the retail investors who benefited from the memestock focus either back then or right now. Pepe, Dogecoin, FLOKI, Dogwifhat and, of course, some random GME-themed memecoins (with no affiliation with the company) gained after Roaring Kitty posted a video suggesting his return. That’s not even mentioning that GameStop’s market cap is back over $9 billion, or that the stock closed up 74% on Monday. AMC, another memestock favorite, closed up 78%. A number of factors made 2021 unique. I’m not saying it’s impossible in this cycle, but the threads may be more similar instead of the exact same. Memecoins dominate today’s market narrative, whereas 2021 saw NFTs booming — nowadays, not so much. There are macro differences, too. Zooming out of crypto, interest rates are sky high with the Federal Reserve holding on to the 5.25%-and-5.50% range since the summer of 2023. Inflation still runs rampant. Retail investors simply aren’t seeing the same economic environment, not to mention the pandemic that was still a thing in 2021. Back then, interest rates were so low that millennials could actually afford to buy houses. The point is: We’re not coming out of lockdown, and we’re seeing crypto bounce back with some weakness after a rough bear market. Of course, that’s not going to stop folks who want to jump into either the memestocks or memecoins. But the conditions don’t look to be ripe enough for a repeat. Just remember: Diamond hands may be forever, but these cycles tend to have a short — and volatile — lifespan. — Katherine Ross Here’s an interesting find: Speculators on the prediction market Polymarket seem to be giving US President Joe Biden similar chances at victory than challenger Donald Trump in a new, major national poll. On Polymarket right now — in a market that has earned more than $125 million worth of bets — Trump leads Biden 49% to 44%. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., meanwhile, pulls a mere 3% — one percentage point less than Michelle Obama, wife of former president Barack Obama. Read more: Stand With Crypto PAC launches as industry interest in campaign funding ramps up Let’s look at the new New York Times poll from this week. Trump leads in an array of battleground states, per the Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer poll. In two of those states, Trump pulls 49% to Biden’s 42%. Biden fares best in Wisconsin, pulling 47% to Trump’s 45%. Interestingly, RFK Jr. polled around 10% in each of the battleground states — a marker of strength for the independent candidate and much stronger than what the folks on Polymarket are saying. The polls and prediction market aren’t moving in tandem, but at some points, they rhyme. To be sure, the crypto-powered Polymarket has been giving Trump strong chances for months. But it’s a fascinating lens for a major political matchup — I’ll be watching as the bets continue to develop. Stay tuned. — Michael McSweeney "},

Alexey Pertsev, the developer of Tornado Cash, has been found guilty of money laundering by Dutch judges at the 's-Hertogenbosch court on May 14.  Pertsev received a sentence of 64 months in prison for allegedly laundering $1.2 billion in illicit assets through the crypto mixing platform. Despite Tornado Cash being a non-custodial protocol—meaning it does not hold or control the funds passing through it—Pertsev was convicted.  A Dutch judge declared Tornado Cash \"intended for criminals\" and stated, \"the criminal user is fully facilitated.\" Between July 9, 2019, and August 10, 2022, the court found Pertsev made \"a habit of committing money laundering\" with Tornado Cash.  The judge emphasized that Pertsev should have been more suspicious about the possible criminal origins of the transactions on the platform.  Pertsev's legal team has 14 days to appeal the court's decision. Pertsev's legal troubles began in August 2022 when he was jailed in the Netherlands shortly after Tornado Cash was blacklisted by the U.S. government. The U.S. Treasury alleged that Tornado Cash was a key tool for the North Korean hacking group Lazarus, implicated in a $625 million hack of Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network and other significant crypto thefts.  This trial sets a precedent for other Tornado Cash developers facing similar charges.  Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, also developers of the crypto mixer, face allegations of money laundering and sanctions violations in the U.S. Storm's trial is set for September, while Semenov has not yet been arrested.  Unlike Pertsev, Storm is not accused of laundering $1.2 billion due to differences in how U.S. and Dutch laws address personal responsibility in such crimes. The trial's outcome could influence future cases involving crypto mixers.  While mixers like Tornado Cash hide the destination of funds and are sometimes used by hackers to launder illicit money, they are not exclusively used for criminal activities. Tornado Cash remains one of the most well-known crypto mixers, but it is not the only one. "},

Both of these banking giants are collaborating with the state investor Temasek for launching this blockchain-based cross-border payments company. The blockchain-based interbank platform is called Partior. The main purpose of these banking giants behind introducing this blockchain platform is to improve the cross-border payments sector making it more efficient than it is currently. In order to improve efficiency in cross-border payments, the platform will utilize blockchain technology and will try to reduce friction existing in these payments as well as in settlements of foreign exchange and trade transactions. In an announcement made on Wednesday, April 28, 2021, the banking giant JP Morgan stated that this new functionality is very beneficial as it will assist in overcoming challenges related to global payment in the financial system. Not only this, using Partior, a wholesale payment infrastructure will also be formed where it will be easy for institutions from across the entire world to change hands at information and value in a frictionless way, and they will be given this facility 24/7, said Takis Georgakopoulos the global head of wholesale payments of JP Morgan. As per the announcement, Partior’s current focus is to accommodate payments only between the banks of Singapore, and there are only two fiat currencies supported for payments which are USD (United States Dollar) and SGD (Singaporean Dollar). However, as time goes on, the platform is expected to be expanded across the other markets around the globe, and also the number of supported fiat currencies will also increase. These firms also revealed the possibility of supporting centralized digital currencies (CBDCs) any time in the future. It is important to note here that prior to working on this blockchain project, they jointly completed Project Ubin as well. "},

Sure, the spotlight has been on spot Ethereum ETF hopefuls since Monday—but the already-trading Bitcoin ETFs have gotten a boost from the excitement. Yesterday Bitcoin ETFs saw $306 million worth of funds deposited, according to Coinglass. That's the biggest single day of inflows the category of funds have seen since earlier this month. Yesterday's distribution across the Bitcoin ETFs wasn't exactly even. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) took in $290 million, while the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw $26 million worth of inflows. That was offset by the Bitcoin Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) seeing $4 million and $6 million worth of withdrawals, respectively. And the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which saw $72.5 million worth of net inflows between May 15 and May 20, was flat on Tuesday, according to Coinglass data. As an aside, the gap GBTC and IBIT has now shrunk to $736 million. That's approximately half what it was less than a month ago. It remains to be seen whether Grayscale's incoming CEO, Peter Mintzberg, will make any changes to the firm's flagship Bitcoin fund. But why would Bitcoin ETFs pump on anticipation for Ethereum counterparts? That could be because some analysts, like Standard Chartered bank, are predicting that an Ethereum ETF approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission could lead both assets—BTC and ETH—to new all-time highs. The global market cap got close to matching that in mid-March, when the Bitcoin price was on a tear and set its currently all-time high of $73,737.94. For Ethereum, that means chasing a price of $4,878.26—which it last saw on November 10, 2021. That's around the time that prices were booming and the global crypto market capitalization inched past $3 trillion for the first time ever. And there are plenty of traders turning to derivatives in hopes it'll do just that. In the past day, Ethereum open interest has surged by 30% to an all-time high of $11 billion, according to Kaiko. 🚀 #ETH open interest surged 30% in 3 days, hitting a new ATH of $11bn as ETF approval hopes grow stronger. 📈 Funding rates flipped positive from yearly lows, signalling a return of bullish sentiment! pic.twitter.com/EbSLvyGDmm — Kaiko (@KaikoData) May 22, 2024  As of this morning, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation now includes the VanEck Ethereum ETF on its active and pre-launch list. Hard to say whether that's a sign of an imminent approval, though. Tickers for Bitcoin ETFs appeared and then disappeared on the clearing house and settlement company's list all the way back in October, which was months before the SEC approved any for trading. "},

The as-yet-identified attacker behind Monday’s $240 million Gala Games token exploit has returned the Ethereum (ETH) gained from selling some of the tokens, as Gala reckons with the fallout from the attack and how to address lingering questions. Approximately 5,913 ETH, or about $22 million, was sent back from the attacker’s wallet to a Gala wallet on Tuesday morning, representing the funds earned from selling 600 million GALA tokens on decentralized exchange Uniswap shortly after Monday’s exploit. In Gala’s Discord server Tuesday, CEO Eric “Benefactor” Schiermeyer said that the firm will “probably buy and burn” GALA tokens using the recovered ETH—a move that could potentially drive up the price of the token following Monday’s dip. On Monday, Schiermeyer wrote in a Discord announcement that the crypto gaming startup believed it knew who was behind the attack, and said it was working with authorities to bring the attacker to justice. The person in question has yet to be publicly identified, and Gala Games would not comment further beyond published statements. Gala published a blog post recounting the attack and the firm’s countermeasures on Tuesday. A wallet with administrative access to the GALA token minting contract minted 5 billion GALA tokens on Monday, or about $240 million worth at the time of the exploit, and then proceeded to start selling them on the open market. After about 45 minutes, Gala was able to block the wallet from making any further sales thanks to a function built into its v2 contract upgrade from last fall. The attacker was able to sell 600 million GALA tokens before that happened, and the price of GALA plunged by 20% during that span as the market contended with the flood of tokens. “We want to assure our community that the minting capabilities of $GALA on GalaChain remain secure and uncompromised,” the post reads. “Our internal controls and multisig security protocols are designed to protect against such incidents, and we are continuously enhancing them to stay ahead of potential threats.” 📢 Important Update We recently detected and addressed a security incident involving $GALA tokens. Thanks to our network’s robust security, the situation was quickly under control. Your GalaChain assets and $GALA Ethereum contract are secure.https://t.co/O3himruM4E — Gala Games (@GoGalaGames) May 21, 2024  However, while the firm claimed that the contract is secure, Schiermeyer previously wrote on Monday that Gala had “messed up” in regards to access to such functions. \"We messed up our internal controls... this shouldn't have happened and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn't ever again,\" he wrote Monday. What about the other 4.4 billion GALA tokens? That’s nearly 9% of the total supply of 50 billion GALA tokens, and they currently sit frozen inside of the attacker’s wallet. On Monday, Schiermeyer wrote that they would be considered “effectively burned,” as they’re inaccessible and can’t be spent. In other words, the Gala ecosystem would consider them removed from circulation. But now, it appears that Schiermeyer’s classification was premature, and the community of Gala network node operators will have the opportunity to vote on the question. “A new Founder’s Node ecosystem governance vote will soon decide if the blocklisted GALA will be considered burned as it relates to GALA’s dynamic supply distribution model as described in the Gala Ecosystem Blueprint,” the post reads.

This follows similar delays for eight other potential Ether ETF issuers, including VanEck. Analysts express skepticism. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on Invesco Galaxy's application for a spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). The SEC has extended the review period by 60 days, with the new deadline set for July 5. This delay is in line with similar postponements affecting all eight prospective Ether ETF issuers, including VanEck, BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. The SEC's decision on Invesco Galaxy's application for a spot Ether ETF has been postponed, giving the commission additional time to review the proposal. The extension of the review period by 60 days pushes the new deadline for a decision to July 5. This delay is part of a series of similar postponements affecting multiple Ether ETF issuers. The final deadline for VanEck's Ether ETF application is May 23, which holds particular significance. Analysts have been closely monitoring this deadline as it could provide insights into the SEC's stance on Ether ETFs. The delay in the decision on Invesco Galaxy's application adds to the uncertainty surrounding the approval of Ether ETFs. Analysts have expressed skepticism about the approval of Ether ETFs, citing regulatory silence and political pressures faced by SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revised down the likelihood of SEC approval for Ether ETFs from 50% to 35%. The prolonged period of regulatory silence and increasing political pushback have contributed to the decreasing likelihood of approval. Despite the skepticism among ETF analysts, some remain optimistic about the potential approval of Ether ETFs. Ethereum advocate Anthony Sassano believes that the SEC could still approve the funds by VanEck's final deadline. Sassano points to the SEC's prior approval of Ether futures ETF products in 2023 and recent meetings between the regulator, Grayscale, and Coinbase as indicators of potential positive outcomes for the pending ETF applications.
